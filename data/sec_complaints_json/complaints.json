february 2019 through at least july 2023 (“relevant period”), \ndefendant eliseo jojo prisno and defendant p/e capital investment management \npartners (“p/e capital”), an investment adviser he controlled (together, the \n“defendants”), violated the federal securities laws by charging many  of their advisory \nclients inflated, unauthorized, and unearned fees.  \n2. defendants oftentimes did so by signing in to their clients’ brokerage \naccounts using their clients’ login credentials —frequently without their clients’ \nknowledge or consent —and then routing multifactor authentication texts to phone \nnumbers under defendants’ control. through this scheme and other deception, they \ncumulatively charged over 220 advisory client accounts approximately $2.4 million in case: 1:25-cv-07491 document #: 1 filed: 07/03/25 page 1 of 14 pageid #:1 2 unauthorized and undisclosed quarterly fees —on top of the disclosed annual advisory \nfees. prisno was personally enriched by charging these fees.  \n3. by engaging in this conduct, defendants violated sections 206(1) and \n206(2) of the investment advisers act of 1940 (“advisers act”) [15 u.s.c. §§  80b-6(1) \nand 80b-6(2)]. defendants will continue to violate the federal securities laws unless \nrestrained or enjoined by this court. the sec therefore seeks a judgment against \ndefendants that includ es: (a) imposing permanent injunctive relief , including prohibiti ng \nprisno from acting as or being associated with a broker, dealer, or investment adviser;  (b) ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest; and (c) imposing \ncivil monetary penalties. \njurisdiction and venue  \n \n4. this court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to sections 209(d) and \n214(a) of the advisers act [15 u.s.c. §§ 80b- 9(d) and 80b-14(a)].  \n5. in connection with the conduct alleged in this complaint, defendants  \ndirectly or indirectly made use of the means or instruments of transportation and \ncommunication in interstate commerce, or of the mails, or of the facilities of a national \nsecurities exchange.   \n6. venue is proper in this court because a cts, practices, and courses of \nbusiness constituting violations alleged herein have occurred within the jurisdiction of the united states district court for the northern district of illinois. prisno resides in this \ndistrict, and p/e capital’s principal  place of business is in this district. \n case: 1:25-cv-07491 document #: 1 filed: 07/03/25 page 2 of 14 pageid #:2 3 defendants  \n \n7. eliseo jojo prisno, age 58, is a resident of chicago, illinois. prisno and his \nwife are co -owners and managers of p/e capital. prisno is the majority owner, chief \nexecutive officer, chief compliance officer, and “senior investment advisor” of p/e \ncapital. he provides all advisory services on behalf of p/e capital and effectively \ncontrols the company and its securities investment decisions. at all times during the \nrelevant period, prisno was an “investment adviser” as that term is defined in the advisers act.  \n8. p/e capital investment management partners is an illinois partnership \nwith its principal place of business in chicago, illinois. it  was founded in 2010 and has \nbeen registered as an investment adviser with the state of illinois since september 2014, \nas well as with california, indiana, and conditionally with texas since 2021. as of july \n2021, p/e capital reported having 150 clients and assets under management of \napproximately $40,500,000. as of january 2025, it report ed having 120 clients and assets \nunder management of approximately $20,500,000. at all times during the relevant \nperiod, p/e capital was an “investment adviser” as that term is defined in the advisers \nact. \nfactual allegations  \ni. background  \n9. defendants provide discretionary investment management services to \nclients, most of whom are of filipino descent and live either in the philippines or the \nunited states. many of p/e capital’s clients are not experienced investors.  case: 1:25-cv-07491 document #: 1 filed: 07/03/25 page 3 of 14 pageid #:3 4 10. defendants entered into investment advisory relationships with and owed a \nfiduciary duty to each of its clients. p/e capital collected advisory fees from its clients. it \ncharged its clients annual fees based on a percentage of their assets under management \n(“advisory  fee”).  during the relevant period, defendants disclosed the following \ninformation about fees  in p/e capital’s form adv part 2a brochure (“brochure”), \nwhich defendants provided to at least some advisory clients:  \n(a) p/e capital charged  its clients who had accounts at \nbrokerage firms a and b advisory fee s of either 2% or \n2.4%.  \n(b) p/e capital did not charge any performance- based fees.  \n(c) p/e capital billed  for its services in arrears; it did not \ncharge the clients in advance or solicit or require \nprepayment of fees.  \n(d) beginning with its brochure filed august 18, 2021, p/e \ncapital first disclosed that it would charge accounts at \nbrokerage firm a enrolled in its “growth hedge \n(nasdaq 100) mip program” 50% of “realized credit options revenue share ,” defined as  “realized gains \nderived from writing derivatives.”   \n11. these were the only fees p/e capital disclose d to defendants’ clients who \nhad accounts at brokerage firm a or brokerage firm b.   \n12. prisno signed the amendments to p/e capital’s form advs, including the \namendments to the brochure filed during the relevant period.  \n  case: 1:25-cv-07491 document #: 1 filed: 07/03/25 page 4 of 14 pageid #:4 5 ii. defendants charged more than $2.4 million in \nundisclosed and unauthorized fees to clients with \ntrading accounts at brokerage firm a.  \n13. brokerage firm a permitted p/e capital’s clients to pre-authorize quarterly \ninvoicing by p/e capital up to a set, authorized dollar limit (“quarterly fee cap”). \nduring the relevant period, defendants used this quarterly fee cap to charge unearned \nand unauthorized quarterly fees—above and beyond the disclosed advisory fees—to many client accounts held at brokerage firm a (“added fees”).  \n14. here’s how they did it:  first, defendants would facilitate the client’s \nopening of a brokerage account with brokerage firm a by creating a username, \npassword, and account security questions for the client on brokerage firm a’s online \nplatform. while some clients changed their passwords, others continued to use the password provided to them by p/e capital. this enabled defendants to access a client’s \naccount without her knowledge. the brokerage account opening documents supplied to the client included no reference to any added fees.  \n15. second, p/e capital would provide brokerage firm a with the client’s \npurported contact information, which oftentimes included a mobile phone number and an \nemail address controlled by defendants, not the client.  \n16. third, defendants —oftentimes within 30 days  of the opening of the \nbrokerage account— would sign in with p/e capital’s adviser username and password \n(“adviser login”) to request a quarterly fee cap. this request, in turn, would trigger \nbrokerage firm a’s request directed to the client for her approval.  \n case: 1:25-cv-07491 document #: 1 filed: 07/03/25 page 5 of 14 pageid #:5 6 17. fourth, defendants would use the client’s login credentials to log into her \nbrokerage firm a account portal. defendants would circumvent brokerage firm a’s \nmultifactor authentication by routing the authentication code—which the brokerage firm \nintended for the client —to themselves.  \n18. fifth, once brokerage firm a’s system authenticated the user, \ndefendants —still posing as their client— would then pretend to approve p/e capital’s \nrequest to establish a quarterly fee cap.   \n19. sixth, p/e capital would then sign in as itself —using its adviser login—\nand invoice its client for an added fee, which oftentimes amounted to the quarterly fee \ncap. \n20. while the amount of the added fees varied over time and by account, \nduring the relevant period the added fees on average amounted to more than twice to \nthree times the disclosed advisory fees.  in other words, while p/e capital disclosed \nadvisory fees of 2% or 2.4%, it actually charged these clients an average of more than \n7% of assets under management —totaling more than $2.4 million in added fees \ncharged to at least 220 client accounts. these added fees were not disclosed to clients in \np/e capital’s brochure or marketing materials . \n21. many, if not all, of these  clients who were charged added fees did not \nknow that p/e capital was charging fees above and beyond the disclosed advisory fee, \nand had not agreed to the added fees, including clients a, b, and c.  \n22. client a. when client a invested with p/e capital in 2020, he was not \naware he would pay any fees other than the advisory fee and did not agree to added case: 1:25-cv-07491 document #: 1 filed: 07/03/25 page 6 of 14 pageid #:6 7 fees. yet d uring the relevant period, defendants charged him over $10,000 in added \nfees—tripling the total fees he paid p/e capital.   \n23. client b. on or around september 24, 2019, p/e capital used its adviser \nlogin to request added fees from a brokerage firm a account held by p/e capital \nclient b. client b never authorized p/e capital to charge any fees other than advisory \nfees. but two days later someone logged into client b’s account,  from the same ip \naddress as the person at p/e capital who used the adviser login to request the added \nfees, and approved the request. client b never so much as saw —let alone approved—the \nfee request.  \n24. client c. client c opened an account at brokerage firm a in october \n2020, with only the 2.4% advisory fee listed in the account application. prisno’s phone \nnumber was set for multi-factor authentication. a quarterly fee cap was later added  in \nmarch 2021 and then raised in november 2021. the “client approval” for these quarterly \nfee caps did not come from client c. rather, the adviser login request and purported \nclient login approval both came from ip addresses that had been used to approve added \nfees in many other  accounts.  \n25. in all, for at least 167 quarterly fee cap changes, both the fee request from \nthe adviser login and the purported fee approval from the client login originated from \nthe same ip address.  \n26. after charging their clients the added fees for more than four years, \ndefendants misconduct stopped when, in or around august 2023, brokerage firm a \nnotified defendants that it would close p/e capital’s advisory account. case: 1:25-cv-07491 document #: 1 filed: 07/03/25 page 7 of 14 pageid #:7 8 iii. defendants charged undisclosed and unauthorized \nfees to clients with trading accounts at brokerage \nfirm b.  \n27. p/e capital disclosed that clients’ accounts held at brokerage firm b \nwould be charged an a dvisory fee (2% before july 15, 2021 and 2.4% after july 15, \n2021), which was supposed to be paid from the accounts in six annual increments, every \n60 days.  \n28. p/e capital was responsible for calculating the advisory fees to be deducted \nfrom the account by  brokerage firm b.  \n29. p/e capital overcharged many of its brokerage firm b clients. during the \nrelevant period, p/e capital charged many client accounts at brokerage firm b with fees \ninconsistent with and higher than the disclosed and agreed -upon advisory fee.  \n30. numerous accounts were also billed at a frequency other than the disclosed \nfrequency of once every 60 days.  \niv. defendants’ ill- gotten gains  \n31. of the more than $3.3 million in fees p/e capital received from its clients \nduring the relevant period, more than $2.4 million came from added  fees  charged to \nclients’ accounts held at brokerage firm a, and more than $100,000 came from \noverbilling advisory fees to clients’ accounts held at brokerage firm b.  \n32. in the relevant period, prisno transferred at least $2.9 million from p/e \ncapital to prisno’s personal checking account, through which he paid for personal \nexpenses.  case: 1:25-cv-07491 document #: 1 filed: 07/03/25 page 8 of 14 pageid #:8 9 v. defendants breached their fiduciary duties  \nto their clients. \n33. defendants are investment advisers. as such, they owe each client \naffirmative duties of utmost good faith, care, loyalty, full and fair disclosure of all \nmaterial facts, and to act in the client’s best interests.  \n34. by engaging in the conduct described above, defendants breached their \nduties to their clients, including by charging undisclosed, unauthorized, and unearned \nfees in amounts without any basis, and by deceptively accessing client accounts through \nclient logins and bypassing multifactor authentication to approve such fees.  \n35. defendants’ misrepresentations and omissions regarding the added fees \nwere material. in making a decision to use defendants as an investment adviser that made \ninvestment decisions on their behalf, a reasonable investor would have considered  it \nimportant that—rather than charging the fees disclosed and represented to clients—\ndefendants instead charged  undisclosed, unauthorized, and unearned fees to client \naccounts, in many cases without client authorization.  \n36. defendants acted with scienter. at the time defendants charged their \nadvisory clients inflated, unauthorized, undisclosed, and unearned fees, defendants knew \nor recklessly disregarded that their representations to prospective advisory clients \nregarding the fees charged to clients’ accounts were false, misleading, and omitted \nmaterial information. defendants knew, or recklessly disregarded, that they received, and \nwere continuing to receive, millions of dollars of manually invoiced quarterly fees, on top \nof the disclosed annual advisory fees. defendants acted with scienter, recklessly, or case: 1:25-cv-07491 document #: 1 filed: 07/03/25 page 9 of 14 pageid #:9 10 negligently by failing to ensure that they only charged their clients the fees they had \ndisclosed to their clients. \nvi. prisno’s continuing misconduct  \n37. in 2022, defendants began undertaking to transition at least some of their \np/e capital clients to other platforms, including ashtree block ventures llc \n(“ashtree”), another investment adviser that prisno controlled.  \n38. between about september 2022 and march 2024, prisno registered ashtree \nwith the sec as an “internet adviser” because he hoped the sec’s imprimatur would \nattract and retain investors and clients. prisno filed a form adv for ashtree claiming it \nhad $5 million in assets under management and 94 clients . prisno did so despite knowing \nthat ashtree was not operational, had zero clients, and zero assets under management. even after sec staff told prisno that ashtree was not eligible to register as an “internet \nadviser,” prisno did not immediately withdraw ashtree’s registration. only after sec \nstaff told prisno that it would be withdrawing ashtree’s registration did he do so on his \nown initiative.  \nvii. this action is timely filed.   \n39. the misconduct at issue in this complaint occurred between about february \n2019 and at least july 2023.  \n40. defendants entered into agreements with the sec in which they agreed to toll \nany statute of limitations applicable to the conduct and claims alleged herein between march 20, 2024 and august 17, 2025 .  \n case: 1:25-cv-07491 document #: 1 filed: 07/03/25 page 10 of 14 pageid #:10 11 claims  for relief \ncount i

\nsolutions, llc (“ k&g”) , and helios venture fund, llc (“helios”) (collectively, \n“defendants”) and relief defendants eric claxton and heather claxton, alleg ing as follows: \nnature of the action \n1. from approximately august 2021 to september 2023 (the “relevant time\nperiod”), gomez used k&g and helios, an entity he wholly controlled, to solicit clients to open \npurported investment advisory accounts that he would manage on their behalf.   \n2. despite helios being termed a “fund,” neither helios nor k&g were investment\nfunds.  rather, k&g and helios  were investment “ advisers ” that, according to the investment case 5:25-cv-00805     document 1     filed 07/14/25     page 1 of 15 2 \n management agreements  gomez had clients sign, “manage [d] and direct [ed] ... on a discretionary \nbasis” each investor ’s “actively traded portfolio of securities that consist of select exchange -\ntraded funds and individual stocks.”    \n3. in soliciting prospective clients, gomez claimed to be an experienced trader who \ncould provide  clients  monthly double -digit returns  by trading securities  on their behalf .  he also \nclaimed that k&g and helios were insured for up to 75%  of the value of each client’s account.  \ngomez, who primarily offered these investment  advisory services to hispanic clients , obtained \napproximately $9 million  of client deposits .  \n4. contrary to defendants’  representations, however, defendants  never used client \nfunds to trade securities , never created or supervised any client accounts, and never obtained \ninsurance for client funds  or accounts .  instead , gomez used client  funds to sustain  a lavish \nlifestyle, make ponzi payments, and fund unrelated business ventures .  he also loaned and \ntransferred approximately $666,000 of client funds to his ex- girlfriend’s father, eric claxton, \nwho, along with his wife, heather claxton, used those funds to purchase real estate. \n5. to conceal the fraud, gomez sent clients fake account statements showing \nfictitious gains on their purported advisory accounts.  when gomez ran out of client assets, he \nclaimed that a “sudden liquidation” essentially destroyed the business and prevented hi m from \nreturning client funds.  he further lulled clients by claiming helios was finalizing a guaranteed bailout loan so he could return clients’ funds.  no such loan existed, and clients never received their money back.  \n6. by engaging in the foregoing activities, defendant s violated  the antifraud \nprovisions  of the federal securities laws, namely section 10(b) of the securities exchange act of \n1934 (“exchange act”) [15 u.s.c. § 78j(b)] and rule 10b- 5 ther eunder [17 c.f.r. § 240.10b- 5]; case 5:25-cv-00805     document 1     filed 07/14/25     page 2 of 15 3 \n section 17(a) of the securities act of 1933 (“securities act ”) [15 u.s.c. § 77q(a)] ; and sections \n206(1) and (2) of the investment advisers act  of 1940 (“advisers act”)  [15 u.s.c. §§ 80b- 6(1), \n(2)].  \n7. the sec brings this action against defendant s seek ing: (i) permanent injunctive \nrelief , including conduct -based injunctions against gomez; (ii) disgorgement of ill -gotten gains , \ntogether  with prejudgment interest ; (iii) a civil penalty against gomez ; and (iv) such further \nrelief the court may deem just and appropriate .  the commission also seeks disgorgement  of ill-\ngotten gains , together with prejudgment interest , from relief defendants eric claxton and \nheather claxton .   \ndefendant s \n8. imer gomez, age 28, is a dual citizen of the u.s. and mexico, and resided in san \nantonio, texas  during the relevant time period .  gomez was the president and cfo of helios.  \nk&g appears to be an assumed name used by gomez to transact business and engage with \nadvisory clients .   \n9. helios venture fund, llc is a texas limited liability company with its \nprincipal place of business in san antonio.  helios purports to be an

pursuant to section 20 of the securities act [15 \nu.s.c. § 77t] , section 27 of the exchange act [15 u.s.c. § 78aa] , and section 214 of the \nadvisers act [15 u.s.c. § 80b- 14].  defendant s transacted business in this dis trict, and certain \nof the acts, practices, transactions, and courses of business constituting violations of the federal securities laws alleged in this complaint occurred within this district.  specifically, gomez resided in and solicited clients  within this d istric t and executed advisory agreements with clients  \nwithin this d istrict.  the relief defendants also reside within this district.  case 5:25-cv-00805     document 1     filed 07/14/25     page 4 of 15 5 \n factual allegations  \na. gomez sol icited clients to deposit money into fake advisory accounts . \n17.  gomez is a self -identified professional gambler with no known experience \ninvesting or managing money on behalf of clients.   in august 2021, gomez began soliciting \nprospective clients  to open purported advisory accounts by having them execute investment \nmanagement services agreements (the “advisory agreements”)  with k&g.   \n18. the initial advisory agreements  identified gomez as k&g’s president and cfo , \nand gomez signed the agreements in his purported role as k&g’s president and cfo .  the  \nadvisor y agreements  also identified k&g as the investment adviser ; in reality, k&g appears to \nnot have been registered with any state as an llc and , upon information and belief, is an \nassumed name used by gomez.  k&g had no bank accounts of its own and gomez directed \nclients  to deposit their funds into bank accounts controlled by gomez  and held in his name.  \ngomez co ntrolled k&g and its decision making.  \n19. sometime in 2022, gomez phased out the k&g name and purportedly began \nopening advisory accounts under a newly formed company named helios.  gomez controlled \nhelios as its sole member.  similar to k&g, gomez requested that new clients execute advisory \nagreements , which identified helios as the investment adviser .  the advisory agreements  listed \ngomez as helios’s president and cfo , and gomez signed the agreements on behalf of helios.  \ngomez controlle d helios  and its decision making.  \n20.  gomez and helios solicited clients (directly and indirectly via word of mouth \nfrom existing clients ) by claiming that he was an experienced securities trader and promis ing to \npurchase and sell securities in separately managed client  accounts that would earn double -digit case 5:25-cv-00805     document 1     filed 07/14/25     page 5 of 15 6 \n monthly  returns.  he told at least one client  via telephone  that he wanted to help the hispanic \ncommunity build generational wealth.   \n21. defendants were each engaged in the business of advising clients as to the \nadvisability of investing in, purchasing, or selling securities for compensation.  k &g and helios \noffered clients three different investment management packages ranging from conservative to \naggressive trading.  the promised returns and accompanying management fees that clients paid to k&g and helios varied depending on the package, with higher returns corresponding to the more aggressive package : \nmanagement packages  package fees  \naggressive day trading  $350 per week  \nweekly / monthly swing  $500 per month  \nlong term growth  $800 per quarter  \n22. the advisory agreements  provided that k&g, and later helios, would select \nsecurities to trade for each client’s purported advisory account that would “protect capital, \ngenerate income and obtain capital growth.”  k&g and helios had broad authority under the agreements to “manage and direct [. . .]  on a discretionary basis” each client’s account and  to \n“purchase, sell, invest, exchange, convert and trade any securities and instruments and any other transaction therein” for the accounts.  in the advisory agreements distributed throughout the \nrelevant time period, k&g and helios represented to clients that k&g or  helios would \nactively trade a portfolio of select exchange- traded funds and individual stocks chosen from a \nk&g or helios newsletter.  however, k&g and helios never distributed  a newsletter  to their  \nclients . \nb. defendants falsely represented to clients  that their investments were covered by \ninsurance.  \n23. during his solicitations , gomez promised prospective clients  that their money \nwould be safe and secure.  similarly, in the advisory agreements, defendants represented that case 5:25-cv-00805     document 1     filed 07/14/25     page 6 of 15 7 \n clients’  purported advisory accounts were covered by insurance (whether the accounts were at \nk&g or helios).  according to the advisory agreements , the client accounts were:  \ninsured for up to 75% of client’s portfolio if the loss is categorized as a 1. \ncatastrophic loss  2. more than 80% loss in a single business day due to market \nwide collapses. catastrophic loss defined as: 10% decline in dji, spx, or nasdaq market indexes in a single business day.  24. gomez reiterated these false statements about insurance when talking to clients  \nand prospective clients .  in or around june 2023, one client requested  proof of the purported \ninsurance , but gomez responded that he was not legally permitted to provide  such  information.   \n25. in fact, defendants never created accounts for clients , nor did they secure \ninsurance for such purported accounts.  when he ultimately ran out of client funds, gomez told \nclients , including those who viewed the insurance coverage as an important part of their decision \nto become a client and to open an account , that helios sought a bailout loan to repay the missing \nfunds  (see paragraphs 33 -35 below) .      \nc. gomez, as k&g and via helios, provided false statements to clients  showing \nsubstantial returns.  \n \n26. per the advisory agreement s, k&g and helios promised to provide weekly \nperformance statements showing each  client’s account performance.  the statements  that \ndefendants actually provided to clients were one- line emails listing account balances that \nconstantly increased.    \n \ncase 5:25-cv-00805     document 1     filed 07/14/25     page 7 of 15 8 \n 27. these account statements that k&g and helios sent to the clients were false.  \nk&g and helios never created or funded individual client accounts.  they never purchased or \nsold securities.  notably, the account statements failed to identify any transactions executed; they just listed a fictitious value, which gomez, on behalf of k&g and helios, artificially increased, which convinced clients of continued growth in their accounts .  additionally, these fictitious \naccount statements persuaded certain clients to send additional funds to gomez to invest  within \nthe purported managed accounts . \nd. defendants misappropriated client  funds and used them for undisclosed purposes, \nincluding making ponzi payments and paying for personal expenses.  \n28. the advisory agreements stated that clients  would deposit their funds into a \nk&g, and later a helios, bank account and that the funds would then be routed to that client’s  \npersonalized and managed account.  after signing the advisory agreement, clients  were \ntypically instructed to send their money to a gomez -controlled bank account .  clients invested \nvia cash and also transferred funds  to defendants via checks, wires, bank transfers, credit cards, \nand online payment systems such as paypal and zelle.  client funds were commingled within \nthese gomez -controlled bank accounts.  \n29. during the relevant time period, gomez received into accounts he controlled \nassets from clients totaling approximately $9 million.  gomez used the majority of client funds to \nmake ponzi payments to other clients , pay personal expenses, pay non -client third parties \n(including for other business ventures), pay employees and pay commissions/bonuses for client referrals, or to make cash withdrawals.   \n30. no client funds were transferred from the accounts gomez controlled to any \ntrading platform.  contrary to the advisory agreements and gomez’s promises to clients , case 5:25-cv-00805     document 1     filed 07/14/25     page 8 of 15 9 \n defendants never created individual client accounts and never used client  funds to buy or sell \nsecurities on clients’ behalf . \ne. gomez transferred client  funds to relief defendants.  \n31. in march and april 2022, eric claxton deposited a total of $100,000 with helios.  \nby june 2022, eric claxton  received these funds back.  thereafter, from june 2022 to march \n2023, claxton also received from helios and gomez approximately $196,000 sourced from \ncommingled client funds.  from june 2023 to august 2023, the claxtons  (eric and heather)  \njointly received  from defendants  another approximately $370,000 from commingled client \nfunds .   \n32. in total, gomez (individually and through helios) sent approximately $666,000 of \ncommingled client funds to eric and/or heather claxton ( including the $100,000 contribution \npaid back to eric claxton) , some of which were characterized as loan s.  eric and heather \nclaxton have : (1) not repaid any of the amounts purportedly loaned by gomez  and ( 2) did not \nprovide a ny services or other value in exchange for such funds . \nf. when client funds ran out, defendants tried to conceal the scheme by misleading \nclients  regarding a n alleged “bailout loan.”  \n33. on september 19, 2023, gomez, in his role as president of helios , sent clients  a \nletter claiming that helios “was impacted by a sudden and unrecoverable liquidation.”  he failed \nto identify  the reasons for the liquidation event, citing a “strict non- disclosure agreement.”  \ndefendants’ bank records show that  what gomez described as a liquidation event was simply  \ngomez running out of money from new clients to continue his scheme.  \n34. in his  letter to clients , gomez claimed that helios had “secured a guaranteed \nbailout loan” from a lender (“lender”) to reimburse clients  for any losses.  gomez represented \nthat (1) the lender’s  commitment to the loan was “steadfast,” (2) loan disbursements would case 5:25-cv-00805     document 1     filed 07/14/25     page 9 of 15 10 \n commence immediately, and (3) all clients  would receive their initial capital by february 1, \n2024.  gomez signed the letter as helios’s president. \n35. gomez’s promises about the bailout loan and repayment of client  funds were \nfalse.  in truth, while gomez met with a  potential lender, he never secured a loan.   even when he \nspoke to the l ender, gomez never provided the lender with  documentation to allow the l ender \nto conduct its required financial due diligence .  \nfirst claim for relief  \n(against defendants gomez and helios)  \nviolations of section 10(b) of the exchange act [15 u.s.c. § 78j(b)] and  \nrule 10b -5 thereunder [17 c.f.r. § 240.10b -5]  \n \n36. plaintiff incorporates by reference each and

defendants gomez and helios)  \nviolations of sections 206(1) and (2) of the advisers act  \n[15 u.s.c. §§ 80b -6(1), (2)]  \n \n42. plaintiff  incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in the \nparagraphs above.  case 5:25-cv-00805     document 1     filed 07/14/25     page 11 of 15 12 \n 43. by engaging in the conduct alleged above, gomez and helios, directly or

public i nformation about \nthat company in the course of your position with [elanco].”  \n22. before and during the relevant period, vakil participated in training course s on \nelanco’s code of conduct, including its insider trading policy.  she completed one  of those \ntrainings in  or around may 2021, and the  written materials provided in connection with that \ntraining included these directives : “do not buy, sell, or trade elanco stock while in possession of \nimportant, nonpublic information about elanco … do not disclose important, nonpublic \ninformation about elanco  to others who may buy, sell, or trade  elanco  stock… [and] take the \nsame trading and disclosure precautions for other publicly traded companies whose important, nonpublic information you may learn about in the course of your work at elanco (for example, companies with which elanco has a significant relationship, existing or proposed) ” \n(emphasis added).  case 7:25-cv-05697     document 1     filed 07/10/25     page 5 of 12  6 ii. vakil participated in elanco’s due diligence of kindred and obtained mnpi about \nthe upcoming acquisition \n23. on april 16, 2021, the same day that elanco  submitted its first non -binding offer \nto acquire kindred, elanco assembled a cross -functional team to complete its due diligence on \nkindred.   \n24. vakil was assigned to the due diligence team that same day to help assess the \ntransaction from a product strategy and technical risk perspective.   \n25. upon being assigned to the due diligence team, vakil was told that the due \ndiligence related to a planned acquisition of kindred and that it was highly confidential .  \n26. although elanco had assigned a code name to the potential acquisition  (“project \nknight”), internal emails – including emails vakil sent and/or received  in connection with her \nwork on the due diligence team – used the name kindred interchangeably with the code name \n“knight .”   \n27. for example, on april 16, 2021, vakil received an email from a senior business \ndevelopment manager and due diligence team  lead with the subject “knight – update,” which \nreferred to kindred by name in the body of the email.   \n28. on april 23, 2021, vakil sent an email to  a colleague in which she herself \nreferred to the due diligence project as “knight (kindred).”   \n29. on may 5, 2021, vakil participated in an email exchange with other members of \nthe due diligence team in which she discussed product data that her team had received from kindred.   \n30. many other  emails written or received by vakil between april 16 and may 12, \n2021 also referred to kindred by name as the subject of the due diligence.   case 7:25-cv-05697     document 1     filed 07/10/25     page 6 of 12  7 31. these communications also highlighted the confidential nature of the potential \ntransaction . \n32. for example, certain emails written or received by vakil referred to project \nknight as “red company confidential information.”   under elanco’s  information handling \npolicies, “r ed” was  the most restrictive designation, and was  reserved for information that \n“requires the most significant protective measures and procedures” because “loss, theft, \nunintentional disclosure or compromise could result in serious damage to elanco.”    \n33. in addition, on at least one occasion, m embers of elanco’s business development \nteam advised vakil  orally  that the prospective acquisition was confidential and sh ould not be \ndisclosed to anyone . \niii. vakil knowingly purchased kindred stock in violation of her duties to elanco  \n34. on may 12, 2021, following an internal meeting in which the project knight due \ndiligence team (including vakil) discussed their initial findings, vakil purchased 500 shares of \nkindred stock in her online brokerage account.   \n35. vakil bought kindred stock because she believed the stock price would increase \nwhen the acquisition was announced.  \n36. although she traded stocks periodically, vakil had not  traded  kindred securities. \n37. the announcement was made before the market open on june 16, 2021.  the \nprice of kindred shares increased by about  46%  from the prior day’s  closing price of $6.34 per \nshare to close at $9.23 per share.   \n38. vakil sold all her kindred shares on june 16, 2021, obtaining ill- gotten gains of  \n$2,447.50. case 7:25-cv-05697     document 1     filed 07/10/25     page 7 of 12  8 iv. vakil knowingly shared mnpi about the acquisition with visen in further \nviolation of her duties to elanco, and visen unlawfully traded on it  \n39. vakil and visen are long -time friends who grew up together in india.  they speak \non the phone periodically and sometimes attend  social events together.  \n40. for example, in february 2020, visen traveled from florida to new jersey to \nspend the weekend at a beach house with vakil and several other friends.  vakil picked visen up \nat newark airport while the other guests traveled separately.    \n41. during 2021, vakil and visen communicated regularly via a n instant  messaging  \napp and weekly videoconference calls, some of which included other friends whom they had \ngrown up with. \n42. in or around may 2021, vakil disclosed to visen that kindred would soon be \nacquired by vakil’s employer, elanco, and that she thought kindred’s stock price would go up as a result.   \n43. vakil mentioned the potential a cquisition two or three times in videoconference \ncalls and instant message  conversations with visen during the month leading up to the \nannouncement , including telling visen that she was working on a project to evaluate the \nproposed a cquisition of kindred for elanco’s leadership.   \n44. in at least one conversation, vakil told visen that she had purchased kindred \nstock for her own account. \n45. on or about june 15, 2021, vakil advised visen that elanco’s acquisition of \nkindred would be announced in a day or two.   \n46. vakil disclosed information about the impending acquisition to visen as an act of \nfriendship, intending that her friend would trade on the information. case 7:25-cv-05697     document 1     filed 07/10/25     page 8 of 12  9 47. visen understood that information about the impending a cquisition was nonpublic \nand that vakil was not permitted to disclose it.  \n48. on june 15, 2021, shortly after vakil informed him of the imminent \nannouncement, visen – an infrequent trader who had never before traded kindred securities – \npurchased 38,000 shares of kindred stock in his  brokerage account.   \n49. the next day, following the announcement, the price of kindred shares increased \nby about  46% from the prior day ’s closing price of $6.34 per share to close at $9.23 per share.  \nas a result, visen generated  ill-gotten gains of $109,437.   \n50. after the announcement , vakil asked  visen if he had purchased kindred stock \nbased on their prior conversations, and when visen said that he had, vakil said “good for you. ” \nv. vakil lied to elanco and the fbi, and asked visen to lie to the fbi for her  \n51. on or about september 21, 2021, for purposes of responding to a finra inquiry, \nelanco emailed a list of individuals who had traded kindred stock ahead of the announcement  to \nall elanco personnel who had been involved in the transaction, including vakil, asking if they \nknew anyone on the list.  visen’s name was on the list.   \n52. vakil responded that she knew no one  on the list , and her false statement was \nincorporated into elanco’s response to finra.   \n53. vakil later told visen about this email exchange with her employer, assuring \nvisen that she had left his name out of her response.   \n54. on december 21, 2023, t he fbi telephon ed vakil  and asked her  about her and \nvisen’s kindred trading.   \n55. during that conversation, vakil  first told  the fbi that she did not learn about the \npotential kindred a cquisition until after she had purchased kindred stock, although she later \nadmitted that was untrue.   case 7:25-cv-05697     document 1     filed 07/10/25     page 9 of 12  10 56. vakil told the fbi that , while she could not recall specifically mentioning the \nplanned a cquisition  to visen , it was possible that  she may have let it slip once as a result of job \nfrustration , but not intending for visen to trade on it . \n57. the fbi concluded the interview by asking vakil if she would call visen and \nallow them to record the conversation.  she said she would consider it and suggested they speak \nagain later that day.   \n58. in the interim, vakil informed visen about law enforcement ’s plan to record the \ntwo of them talking.  vakil asked visen to corroborate her story that she only mentioned the planned acquisition to him once during a moment of job- related frustration, which was false.  \nvisen , however, declined to answer when vakil called him back with the fbi on the line.   \nfirst claim for relief  \nviolation  of exchange act section 10(b) and rule 10b -5 thereunder \n59. the commission re -alleges and incorporates by reference here the allegations in \nparagraphs 1 through 58.  \n60. vakil and visen , directly or indirectly, in connection with the purchase or sale of \nsecurities and by the use of means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or the mails, or the facilities of a national securities exchange, knowingly o r recklessly (i) employed one or more  \ndevices , schemes , or artifice s to defraud, (ii) made one

  document 1     filed 07/10/25     page 10 of 12  11 61. by reason of the foregoing, vakil and visen , directly or indirectly, violated and, \nunless enjoined, will again violate exchange act section

raised approximately $4 million from about 300 \ninvestors located across multiple states , through the fraudulent and unregistered sale of securities .   \n2. go x operates a scooter  rental business in markets  including several florida cities, \nhonolulu, and las v egas.  defendants promoted go x’s investment program on its public website , \nin videos posted on youtube, in direct communications with prospective investors, and in written \nagreements .  case 1:25-cv-23002-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 07/03/2025   page 1 of 20  \n \n 2  \n \n 3. in their sales pitch, defendants represented to investors that go x would pay \ninvestors a share of its gross profits from scooter rental  fees, in exchange for the investors ’ principal \npayment to go x, which typically ranged from $2,000 to $30,000.  they  also represented that \nthrough the profit -sharing, investors could expect to be paid back their principal plus receive \nreturns up to 100 percent in a year or less. t he go x website claim ed that investors had  earned  \nmore than $3 million  by august 2022.  in addition, defendants portrayed go x as less risky than \ninvesting in the s&p 500, touting “guaranteed” investor refunds upon request and claiming that \ninvestor funds could be lost only if go x went out of business.  \n4. these representations were false and misleading.  by the end of 2023, go x had \npaid investors only about $1.45 million—less than half of the approximately $4 million in principal \nit raised from investors .  go x also failed to pay supposedly “guaranteed” refunds when investors \nrequested them.  in addition, go x operated  a sharply unprofitable  business , putting unwitting \ninvestors at substantial risk.  \n5. the poor performance of the go x investment led to multiple complaints from \ndissatisfied investors, yet defendants  continued to sell the investment with the same sales pitch.   \n6. by engaging in the conduct described in this complaint, go x violated sections \n5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the securities act of 1933 (“securities act”)  [15 u.s.c. §§ 77e(a), 77e(c), \nand 77q(a )], and section 10(b) of the securities exchange act of 1934

sections 21(d), 21(e), and \n27 of the exchange act [15 u.s.c. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa].  \n12. in connection with the conduct alleged in this complaint, defendants, directly or \nindirectly, singly or in concert  with others, made use of the means and instrumentalities of \ninterstate commerce, the means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce, or of the mails .   case 1:25-cv-23002-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 07/03/2025   page 3 of 20  \n \n 4  \n \n 13. this court has personal jurisdiction over the defendants and venue is proper in this \ndistrict pursuant to section 22(a) of the securities act [15 u.s.c. § 77v(a)] and section 27(a) of \nthe exchange act [15 u.s.c. § 78aa(a)]  because c ertain offers and sales of securities, acts, and \ntransactions that form the basis for the violations alleged in this c omplaint occurred in this district.  \nfor example, during the relevant time, go x maintained an office in miami, florida which debelov has described as go x’s “headquarters” and debelov maintains a residence in this district.  additionally, at least six investors resided in this district w hen they invested.      \niv. factual allegations  \na. the go x business and securities offering  \n14. go x offers scooters for rent to the public in markets located in u.s. cities  including \nhonolulu, hawaii ; las vegas,  nevada; daytona beach, florida ; and other florida cities.  go x \npays a portion of the rental fees  it collects  to its “partners,” which are the operators of the locations \nwhere the scooters are docked, typically retail stores and hotels in resort areas.   \n15. from approximately july 2021 through november 2023, go x raised around $4 \nmillion by offering and selling s ecurities to approximately 300 investors in multiple u.s. states.   \ngo x promoted its investment program through various means including content on its public \nwebsite , which content was overseen and approved by debelov , and videos posted to youtube in \nwhich debelov appeared and spoke  as the company’s ceo .  debelov also personally promoted \nthe go x investment program to prospective investors , including through email  and telephone \nconversations. \n16. when individuals expressed interest in the go x investment through the go x \nwebsite, debelov provided salam with their contact information to follow up.  salam then reached out to the prospective investors by telephone, email, and/or text message.  salam described the case 1:25-cv-23002-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 07/03/2025   page 4 of 20  \n \n 5  \n \n investment program to the prospects, including among other things, the expected rates  of return  \nand that investors would receive monthly payments of their returns .  he also directed prospects to \nthe go x videos on youtube.   \n17. about half of the i nvestors signed written agreements  with go x to effect  their \ninvest ments (“investor agreements”) .  debelov approved the form of the investor agreement s.  \nusing his ceo title, debelov  was also go x’s signatory on the investor agreements .  both debelov \nand salam provided investors with investor agreements  to sign, typically by emailing the investor \na website link to an electronic copy of the agreement.   investors that were not provided investor \nagreements effectuated their investment by paying go x their principal investment amounts . \n18. investors typically paid between $2,000 and $30,000 for an  investment .  some \nmade multiple investments.   investor funds were comingled in common bank accounts that go x \nused to pay its general  operati ng expenses .  \n19. investors were passive and had a reasonable expectation of earning a profit or return \nwhich was derived entirely from the purported efforts and strategies of the defendants.  for \nexample, the investor agreement s stated:  “go x will take care of all operations, provide the \nsoftware solution, fix and deploy scooters at all partner locations.  go x will also retain a legal firm, pr firm and run online ads in order to increase the rentability of scooters. . . .  all of this will help the [investor] recoup and e arn . . . interest on their purchase in the most reasonable time \nframe.”   \n20. echoing this language, salam sent emails and text messages to prospective and \nexisting investors stating variously that:  (i) “investing in go x is an opportunity to earn passive income by owning a percentage of our fleet;” (ii) investors were “tapping into” go x’s “total revenu e” from all of its markets; and (iii) “ you don’t own 25 individual scooters; rather, you hold case 1:25-cv-23002-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 07/03/2025   page 5 of 20  \n \n 6  \n \n a stake in the earnings generated collectively by 1,500 scooters across our hawaii and florida \nmarkets.”  debelov also emailed existing investors representing that the go x investment program \noffered “passive income.”   \n21. indeed , go x made the essential managerial efforts that affected the success or \nfailure of its  business  and the investment program .  this included, but was not limited to, launching \noperations in various markets ; marketing scooter s to consumers ; recruiting , contracting with, and \npaying the partners ; collecting scooter rental fees ; maintaining the scooters ; and handling \npermitting and other legal requirements of the cities where go x operated .   \nb. the pitch to investors  \n22. as defendants framed the go x program for investors —including in the investor \nagreements , on the go x website,  in the youtube videos, and in debelov ’s and salam’s direct  \ncommunication s with investors —investors would receive a share of the gross profits that go x \nearned from  renting scooters .   \n23. in promoting the go x investment program, defendants told investors to expect \nthat this profit- sharing would provide investors with extraordinary returns in a short period of time \nwith exceptionally low risk .   \n24. for example, go x promoted the investment program with content on its public \nwebsite that was overseen and approved by debelov.  at various times during the fraudulent \noffering, the website included the following claims : \n• “you make $ when someone rents a scooter from us .  we will \nshare 50% of the gross profit”  (emphasis in original)  \n• through such profit -sharing, an investor could “1.5x your money” in as little as “ 88 \ndays” case 1:25-cv-23002-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 07/03/2025   page 6 of 20  \n \n 7  \n \n • “investors on go x platform earned” more than $3 million “in the last \n180 days”  \n• a person who “in august 2021 . . . invested $20k into go x” would have achieved a “gain” of “+100%” by may 2022 \n• the 100 percent gain “is just compared [sic] based on returns, but if you look at other attributes of this investment like risk -tolerance, liquidity and your ability to lose money, \nthen go x stands in a completely different league (!) compared to all investments on the \nmarket”  \n• unlike investors in the s&p 500, go x investors had “0 risk” and “[ no] . . . ability to \nlose money . . . *unless go x goes out of business”  \n25. the promotion of the go x investment program also included videos posted to \nyoutube in approximately october and november 2022.  in the se videos, debelov appeared and \nspoke over the caption “ceo, go x .”  he claimed that early investors had made returns of “i think \nit was 100 percent over twelve months” and that later investors were “getting a 50 percent return .”   \n26. in a separate youtube video narrated by debelov and posted in approximately j une \n2022, debelov claimed that go x provided investors with “monthly cash flow.”     \n27. debelov and salam also promoted the go x investment in their direct \ncommunications with investors .  for example : \n• salam typically had phone calls with prospective investors in which he described how the go x program worked, including the expected rate of return.   \n• in or about january 2023, salam claimed in text messages  to a prospective investor that the \ngo x “platform” was “completely sold out ” and had “limited availability  right now ,” but \nthe prospect could invest a “max” of “$20k.”  salam also assured the prospect that he  could case 1:25-cv-23002-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 07/03/2025   page 7 of 20  \n \n 8  \n \n reasonably expect a fifty percent return in one year and would receive monthly payments \nfrom go x.   \n• in a phone call around the same time, the prospect expressed skepticism to salam that go \nx could provide such a return, and salam assured the prospect that go x could do so.   \n• salam and debelov each sent prospective investors emails claiming that “our investors  \n[had] made over  $3m on the platform .  as we calculated the average rate of return across \nall markets, it came out to an astonishing 87% annual return for a typical investor on \n[the] go x platform! ” (emphasis in original).  their emails also claimed  that the go x \ninvestment was “no -risk,” provided “monthly payouts ,” and “produces returns that are 4x \nof leading funds ,” and urged prospective investors to “see how it compares to other \nproducts on the market here:  https://goxapp.com/invest .”  \n28. the investor agreements , which debelov and salam provided to investors, also \ntouted the performance of the go x investment.  two iterations of the investor agreement were \nused, an original “1.0” version and a later “2.0” version.  the se variously included statements that \n1.0 investors could expect to “be paid” double their investment amount and expect to “earn that \nmoney anywhere between 3- 6 months”; that the “majority” of 1.0 investors had “doubled or were \non track to double their funds within 6- 11 months of their initial investment”; that 2.0 investors \n“should expect to 1.5x their investment  within 6 -12 months”; and that 2.0 investors would “be paid \nmonthly on their earnings .”   \n29. the investor agreements  further stated that go x provided a “100% product \nguarantee” and would refund investments upon investor request.  consistent with this claim, in the june 2022 youtube video identified above, debelov said, “[i]f you’re not happy with your \ninvestment, you can request a refund and we’ll happily refund your money within that same day.”   case 1:25-cv-23002-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 07/03/2025   page 8 of 20  \n \n 9  \n \n likewise, in february 2023, salam emailed a prospective investor a “welcome letter ” from \ndebelov , which said:   “at any point , if you would like to get your money back, then just email me \n. . . and i’ll make sure you get it refunded to your card or wired within 24 hours.”      \nc. defendants  violated the antifraud provisions of the exchange act and securities \nact \n30. defendants  knew , or were severely reckless  in not knowing, that the sales pitch to \ninvestors was false and misleading because it overstated past performance of the go x investment, \noverstated potential future performance of the investment, and understat ed investment risk.  \n31. the claim that investors had “earned” more than $3 million “in the last \n180 days” suggested that the go x investment had performed well in the past and that it was \nlikely to continue to do so in the future.  but the claim was false and misleading. \n32. the claim first appeared on the go x website no later than august 2022.  b y then , \nhowever, go x had only paid roughly $800,000 in returns to investors —far short of $3 million— \naccording to its accounting records .  the claim was repeated on the website in december 2022  and \nin march, june, and september 2023.   \n33. according to go x accounting records, during the relevant time, go x never \nreturned $3 million to investors.  t hrough december 2023, go x paid only approximately \n$1.45 million in returns to investors ; in other words, go x had returned less than half of the \napproximately $4 million in principal  it raised from investors .  debelov knew , or was severely \nreckless  in not knowing, that the claim that go x investors had earned more than $3 million in 180 \ndays falsely  and misleadingly portrayed the go x investment’s past and expected future \nperformance because he regularly reviewed go x accounting records show ing the amount of \nreturns paid to investors.   debelov also knew , or was severely reckless  in not knowing, that the case 1:25-cv-23002-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 07/03/2025   page 9 of 20  \n \n 10  \n \n extraordinary past and expected future performance of the go x investment touted elsewhere on \nthe go x website, in the investor agreements, in the youtube videos, and in his emails to \nprospective investors , as described above, was likewise false and misleading.    \n34. the sales pitch also falsely and misleadingly understated investment risk because \ngo x lacked the financial strength to perform as the pitch told investors to expect .  as debelov \nknew , or was severely reckless  in not knowing, from his review of go x accounting records , go \nx’s scooter rental revenue during 2021 through 2023 totaled roughly $8.5  million —meaning it \nwould take half of that revenue just to return the principal go x raised from investors .  from the \nsame accounting records , debelov also knew , or was severely reckless  in not knowing, that go x \nrecorded a negative net income in each of 2021, 2022, and 2023, with a cumulative recorded \nnegative net income across the three years  of approximately $1 million.  these facts cast serious \ndoubt on the company’s ability to return investor principal, let alone pay the touted extraordinary \nreturns , and to guarantee refunds .  debelov therefore also knew, or was severely reckless in not \nknowing, that the “0 risk” claim and comparison to the s&p 500 on the go x website described \nabove were false and misleading.  \n35. investor complaints  received by debelov further show that  debelov knew , or was \nseverely reckless  in not knowing, that the go x investment did not perform as represented in the \ninvestor sales  pitch .  from at least june 2022 to november 2023, debelov received multiple \ncomplaints from dissatisfied investors , including complaints about not receiving expected returns \nand unpaid refunds.  yet debelov and go x continued promoting the investment  to new investors  \nusing the same sales pitch containing misrepresentations about past performance, expected returns, \nand guaranteed refunds . case 1:25-cv-23002-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 07/03/2025   page 10 of 20  \n \n 11  \n \n 36. salam  also knew , or was severely reckless  in not knowing, that the go x sales pitch \nwas false and misleading.  among other things, he monitored the go x website , which contained \nthe past and expected future performance claims described above; he described the go x program \nto prospective investors, including the  expected rates  of return;  he provided investors with the \ninvestor agreement s, which included the claims of past and expected future performance as well \nas the refund guarantee  described above;  and he sent the emails to prospect ive investors  referenced \nabove describing past performance  of the go x investment .  salam therefore knew , or was severely \nreckless in not knowing, that go x , a small scooter rental company,  implausibly offered investors \nthe prospect of extraordinary  returns , guaranteed refunds , and less risk than investing in the s&p \n500.   \n37. salam also learned of investor complaints , as shown by the following examples : \n• in june 2022, salam was copied on an investor’s email complaining to debelov where the \ninvestor stated :  “i’ve reached out a few times and i’m wondering what i need to do to start \ngetting my monthly payouts. . . .  it’s been several months and i still have yet to get a single payout from my balance.”  the investor had invested in november 2021.  \n• in august 2022, an investor complained to salam and debelov by email about not receiving \nmonthly payments.  in february 2023, the investor complained again to salam by email, \ncopying debelov, writing that he still was not receiving the payments.  salam replied to \nthe investor that the investor  could expect a payment that week.  in march 2023, the \ninvestor emailed salam, copying debelov, noting that he did not receive the payment.  \n• in october 2022, an investor complained by email to salam, stating:  “i am past my $5k \npayback and contract states that contract/agree [sic] make double your money which \nclearly i have not.”  case 1:25-cv-23002-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 07/03/2025   page 11 of 20  \n \n 12  \n \n • in march 2023, an investor began complaining to salam and debelov in an email string \nabout missing monthly payments.  later in the string , in june 2023, the investor wrote :  “i \nam having trouble with payouts again. . . . schedule [sic] payouts were never met.”  in \naugust 2023, the investor wrote in the string that  he still was owed money.  he also wrote \nin an email to debelov :  “i’m starting to feel like i got scammed.”  \n• in april 2023, an investor emailed salam and debelov that he and two other individuals \nwho were “early investors” in go x had been receiving low payments or no payment in some months.  the investor also wrote:  “there has [sic] been constant inconsistencies with payment time frames . . . .  we are always having to reach out for our monthly deposits, asking several times for payment.  we are completely confused and lost as to what’s going on with our money and need clarification.”  \n• in may 2023, an investor complained by email to salam and debelov that she had invested \nin november 2022, and based on the investment performance so far, “it will take years to \nmake a profit , as opposed to the 10 months i was told.”  \n• in june 2023, salam and debelov received a n email complaint from an investor stating that \nafter approximately sixteen months, “i havent [sic] seen a return on my initial investment.”  \n• in august 2023, an investor complained by email to salam and debelov that he had “asked \nkindly to withdraw my remaining $3,000 from my account for almost a year,” adding, “i am turning all of this over to my lawyer next week if i don’t hear back from you.”  \n• also i n august 2023, an investor complained by email to salam and debelov that “[i]t has \nbeen almost 2 years with no [sic] even receiving my initial investment back which is laughable.”  the investor also asked that go x pay him his “remaining balance . . . or i will have no choice but to look at alternative options to get your attention.”  case 1:25-cv-23002-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 07/03/2025   page 12 of 20  \n \n 13  \n \n • additionally in august 2023, an investor complained by email to salam, “i have not \nreceive [sic] a payout”;  “i want to pull out everything” ; and “i will go to the proper \nauthorities!”  \n38. even after receiving these complaints, salam continued using the  false and  \nmisleading sales pitch to solicit investors.  in particular, after the august 2023 complaints, salam \nwent on to sell investments tied to a new market go x was launching in las vegas.    \n39. despite the investor complaints , and the implausible returns , purported low risk , \nand guaranteed refunds  touted in the go x sales pitch, salam never investigate d the truthfulness \nof the representations he  used to solicit investors .   \n40. the false and misleading representations that defendants disseminated to investors \nin the sales pitch described above were material.  in making an investment decision, it would have been important for a reasonable investor to know, for example, that the purported past performance of the go x investment, including the repeated $3 million claim, was false; that go x failed to pay \nrefunds upon request; and that go x was unprofitable.  \nd. defendants violated federal securities registration provisions           \n41. as stated above, go x, through debelov and salam, offered and sold approximately \n$4 million in securities  to approximately 300 investors  residing in multiple states.  in doing so, \ndefendants used general solicitation, including a public website and youtube videos, and did not take reasonable steps to verify investors’ accredited investor status.  \n42. contrary to the requirements of the federal securities laws, no registration statement \nwas on file with the commission or in effect for any of these offers or sales, and no exemption from registration applied to the offers or the sales.   case 1:25-cv-23002-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 07/03/2025   page 13 of 20  \n \n 14  \n \n v. claims for relief  \ncount i

(“stack”).  stack is \na sports media company that palazzo founded in 2 005, largely sold in 2017, and was trying to then \nrepurchase.  he further represented to all three inve stors that he either had or would shortly secure \n$5 million in third-party funding.  n one of this was true.  instead, shortly after receiving investor \nfunds, he immediately spent the money to pay un disclosed debts, litigation fees, and personal case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 2 of 39  \ncomplaint   \n3  \n  1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728expenses, including his children’s private school tu ition and personal rent.  also, palazzo knew, or \nwas reckless or negligent in not knowing, that he  had not secured or woul d not shortly secure $5 \nmillion in third-party funding.  \n6. second, in the play caller scheme, betw een at least september 2020 and december \n2023, palazzo raised approximately $2.1 million from at least 22 i nvestors by offering and selling \nconvertible promissory notes thr ough play caller and its majority owner, np ventures.  palazzo \nrepresented that investor funds would be used to develop and imm inently launch the play caller \nsports-betting application.  once ag ain, this was not true.  instea d, palazzo misappropriated more \nthan 75 percent of investor funds  to (a) pay personal expenses, including vacations to disneyland \nand hilton head island, south carolina, (b) sett le an unrelated lawsuit, and (c) pay himself \nexorbitant consulting fees.   \n7. as a result of the alleged conduct, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions \nof section 17(a) of the securities act, 15 u.s.c.  §77q(a), and section 10(b) of the exchange act, \n15 u.s.c. §78j(b), and rule 10b-5 thereunder, 17 c.f.r. § 240.10b-5.  palazzo is also liable as a \ncontrol person for the corporate defendants’ violat ions of section 10(b) of the exchange act and \nrule 10b-5 thereunder pursuant to s ection 20(a) of the exchange act. \n8. the sec seeks a judgment from the court, as set forth in more precise detail in the \nprayer for relief: (i) permanently enjoining th e defendants from violati ng securities act section \n17(a) [15 u.s.c. §77q(a)], and exchange act sect ion 10(b) [15 u.s.c. §7 8j(b)], and rule 10b-5 \nthereunder [17 c.f.r. § 240.10b-5];

individual e a nd palazzo are longtime \nfriends and business associates.  \nfactual allegations \na. palazzo’s past lawsuits and business problems motivated his fraud.  \n25. one of palazzo’s key motivations for perpetrating two fraudu lent schemes and \nmisappropriating millions of dollars in investor funds were the laws uits against him and associated \nlegal and settlement expenses that he incurred.  as outlined below, these difficulties are relevant because they demonstrate palazzo’s motive and scient er in connection with the fraudulent schemes.  case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 6 of 39  \ncomplaint   \n7  \n  1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728indeed, from 2015 through 2020, palazzo accumulated a significant amount of debt related to \nseveral businesses, was involved in several laws uits, and was terminated from his job.  palazzo \nraised funds from investors by te lling them it was for business purposes; however, he used a \nsignificant amount of the invest or funds to pay the debts a nd expenses described below. \n26. in 2005, palazzo founded stack, a youth sports media company.  over time, \nstack had a number of investors and creditors that it owed m oney to.  by may 2017, stack had \nmore than $18.6 million in outstanding liabilities.  \n27. in mid-2017, palazzo sold substantially all of stack’s assets to spay for $9.5 \nmillion.  after selling stack, palazzo joined spay as  its chief digital officer.  during this time, \npalazzo faced mounting difficultie s because he failed to fully re pay some of stack’s investors \nand creditors and also concealed from spay some of stack’s liabilities,  as set forth below: \na. between 2017 and 2019, and while he was st ill employed as spay’s chief digital \nofficer, palazzo failed to fully repay all of  stack’s investors a nd creditors after the \nspay sale, resulting in at least two lawsu its by stack investors against palazzo and \nhis companies for fraud and breach of contract. \nb. palazzo also concealed from spay the extent of stack’s debts to entity a.  entity \na was stack’s largest customer and th eir substantial monetary relationship \nrequired both stack and entity a to make payments to and receive payments from \neach other.  subsequently, entity a went into receivership in april 2019.  then, \nfrom approximately june 2019 to early november 2019, palazzo concealed from \nspay the fact that entity a’s receiver  was demanding money from spay.  indeed, \nuntil early november 2019, spay’s understanding was that entity a owed stack millions of dollars.  palazzo admitted in testimony during the sec’s investigation of \nthese events that he attempted to reso lve these demands by wiring $250,000 to entity \na’s receiver in october 2019 without spa y’s knowledge.  then, in november 2019, \nentity a’s receiver contacted spay directly, claiming that spay owed entity a more \nthan $4 million.  spay terminated palazzo’s  employment in april 2020.  and in july case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 7 of 39  \ncomplaint   \n8  \n  1\n23456789\n101112131415161718192021222324252627282020, spay subsequently sued palazzo and other stack executives for concealing \nthe nature of entity a’s relationshi p and misappropriating spay’s funds. \nc. additionally, in 2015, palazzo, on behalf of st ack, entered into an agreement with \nmarketing firm b, a sports management  company, whereby stack would solicit \nsponsorships and advertising for marketing firm b.  under the agreement, stack \nreceived a $300,000 advance and was requi red to generate a minimum of $600,000 \nin revenue.  according to individual e, one of market ing firm b’s owners, stack \ndid not generate the required revenue and wa s required to repay the advance, plus the \nrevenue shortfall.  palazzo testified that he  made repayments to marketing firm b at \nleast through 2019 and 2020.  spay was not aware of this agreement or debt. \n28. separately, by on or around october 4, 2019, palazzo and a palazzo-controlled entity \nwere sued for fraud, breach of contract, and other legal violations related to a $1 million transaction \nthat occurred in july 2019.  this lawsuit (the “2019 civil lawsuit”) was unrelated to spay or the \ncorporate defendants. \nb. palazzo and 4ta sports fraudulently ra ised at least $900,000 from investors \nby misrepresenting that the funds would be used to repurchase stack. 1. overview of the stack scheme.\n \n29. by 2019, palazzo became unhappy with his 2017 sale of stack and began \nnegotiating with spay to repurch ase some of stack’s assets.  (palazzo often referred to \nrepurchasing stack’s assets as simply repurchasing stack, and for simplicity this complaint \nrefers to it the same way.)  pa lazzo formed 4ta sports to se rve as the company that would \nrepurchase stack and is the sole  shareholder of 4ta sports.  \n30. between october 2019 and march 2020, palazzo  and 4ta sports raised at least \n$900,000 from three investors for the stack repurchas e.  palazzo first a pproached two former \nharvard football teammates (“inve stor 1” and “investor 2”) in oc tober 2019.  he explained to each \nof them that he would use their investment to repurchase stack.  he convinced both to invest \nafter representing that he had already secure d a $5 million funding comm itment and presenting a \npurported funding agreement signed by individual e on behalf of consulting company c.  the case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 8 of 39  \ncomplaint   \n9  \n  1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728funding agreement purported that 4ta sports pr omised to pay consulting company c $5 million \nwith interest “for value received.”  palazzo further represented that consulting company c was a “family office,” a term used to refer to a private wealth management office  established by an ultra-\nhigh-net worth family, which lent  an air of credibility, sophis tication, and secu rity to the \ninvestment.  palazzo’s statements to investors 1 and 2 were false.  not only had palazzo not secured \n$5 million in funding, but also, shortly after re ceiving $250,000 from each investor, palazzo began \nusing the money on debts and legal and personal e xpenses unrelated to th e repurchase of stack. \n31. after palazzo had misappropr iated almost all the $500,000 from investors 1 and 2, \nhe sought out a new victim.  in and around march 2020, he spoke with his ne xt victim (“investor \n3”), who owned a youth sports training center.  he convinced investor 3 to invest $400,000, again \nclaiming he had secured a $5 mi llion funding commitment and pres enting a different purported $5 \nmillion funding agreement between  4ta sports and media company d.  the funding agreement \npurported that 4ta sports woul d receive $5 million in funding in march 2020.  palazzo also \nassured investor 3 that her funds would be used to repurchase stac k.  none of this was true.  \nindeed, shortly after receiving investor 3’s funds, palazzo used the funds for personal expenses and \nfor legal debts and fees unrela ted to repurchasing stack.  \n32. palazzo never used investor funds for e xpenses associated with an attempt to \nrepurchase stack.  to the contrary, palazzo used at least 90% of the funds  on unrelated debts and \nlitigation expenses, as well as pe rsonal expenses such as priv ate school tuition and vacations.  \nultimately, palazzo never repurchased stack.  th e specific details of palazzo’s stack scheme \nare described below. \n2. palazzo and 4ta sports defrauded two former harvard football \nplayers through a securities offering.  \n33. in october 2019, palazzo reached out to investors 1 and 2 seeking $250,000 from \neach of them.  he explained to bo th investors that he intended to use their funds for the repurchase \nof stack.    case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 9 of 39  \ncomplaint   \n10  \n  1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728a. investor 1   \n34. during the investment process, palazzo both spoke with his friend and former \nteammate investor 1 and sent him emails.  pal azzo, as 4ta sports’ sole officer, proposed an \ninvestment opportunity to his fr iend.  in return for investor  1 committing $250,000, 4ta sports and \npalazzo offered to provide investor 1 with th e following: (1) a $250,000 secured promissory note \nwith a maturity date just two w eeks after the deal (oct ober 31, 2019) with a 6% interest rate and a \npreferred return of 10% ($25k), (2 ) a warrant to purchase to 6 2,500 shares in 4ta sports at $.01, \n(3) a security agreement granting investor 1 a secu rity interest in and lie n on 4ta sports’ assets, \nand (4) a pledge agreement granting investor 1 a firs t priority security intere st in all of palazzo’s \n4ta sports stock. \n35. in an october 10, 2019 email to investor 1, palazzo explained th at he was at the \n“finish line” in his repurchase of stack.  he fu rther explained that he was “about $250k short in \nthe interim for these working capital true-ups, wh ich i hadn’t planned to address until post-closing \nas is the traditional treatment.”  in this same ema il, palazzo claimed that “i have the full financing \ncommitted ($5m) by a family office in texas who is al so an investor in [redacted], which is one of \nthe top trainers in the nation and an  original advisory board member of stack.”  in response to this \nemail, investor 1 expressed that he would like to help, but that he wanted  to speak, in part, to \nunderstand the risk associated with  the investment.  in a follow- up email, palazzo then provided \ninvestor 1 a copy of a convertible  promissory note between 4ta sports and consulting company c \n(the purported family office), dated septem ber 23, 2019, which supposedly documented consulting \ncompany c’s agreement to prov ide $5 million to 4ta sports.  \n36. after speaking with palazzo and accepting hi s representations, i nvestor 1 signed the \nwarrant agreement and security ag reement.  palazzo executed these same documents, as well as the \npromissory note and pledge agreement, as th e chairman of 4ta sports.  after receiving \ninstructions from palazzo, investor 1 then wired $250,000 on october 15, 2019, to a bank account \nassociated with one of pal azzo’s other entities.    case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 10 of 39  \ncomplaint   \n11  \n  1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728b. investor 2 \n37. during this same period, palazzo also reach ed out to investor 2 to secure $250,000 in \nfunds, again offering a promissory note, 4ta sports  warrants, a security agreement, and a pledge \nagreement in return.  in emai ls dated between october 10 and 11, 2019, palazzo presented investor \n2 with the same deal terms proposed to investor 1.  palazzo represented that the funds would be \nused to “clean up some of the working capital fro m the acquisition from 2017 to now and for me to \nrepay approximately $250k of capital that they funded into stack before the deal closes.”  palazzo \nfurther represented that: “i have  the financing and deal documen tation completed to close on the \nacquisition of the stack assets as soon as the family office can fund, which is expected to be next \nweek, but could possibly slip into  the following week.”  in respons e to questions from investor 2, \npalazzo doubled down and stated the “family offi ce is fully committed” a nd “they have committed \nto fund me with the $5m regardless  as to if i buy the stack assets  back.”  palazzo also provided a \ncopy of a convertible promissory  note between 4ta sports and consulting company c, dated \nseptember 23, 2019, which supposedly documented consulting company c’s agreement to provide $5 million to 4ta sports. \n38. after palazzo’s representati ons to investor 2, invest or 2 signed the security \nagreement and warrant agreement on october 11,  2019.  palazzo executed these same documents, \nas well as the promissory note and pledge agreement, as the chairm an of 4ta sports.  investor 2 \nthen wired $250,000 on october 15, 2019 to a 4ta sports bank account. \n39. palazzo’s transactions with investors 1 and 2 constituted an offer and sale of \nsecurities.  indeed, the warrants on their face warn the holder, in part, that they are securities subject \nto certain transfer restricti ons under the federal securities la ws.  additionally, the secured \npromissory notes were interest -bearing notes that ar e defined as securities under the federal \nsecurities laws, and further operate as securi ties because (1) 4ta sports and palazzo were \nmotivated to use the funds to finance a substantial investment, (2) a reasonable investor would have \nbeen motived by the profit generated, including the 6% return, (3) a r easonable member of the \ninvesting public would have cons idered the secured promissory not es securities, and (4) no risk-\nreducing factor, such as an altern ative regulatory regime, would make applicati on of the securities case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 11 of 39  \ncomplaint   \n12  \n  1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728laws unnecessary.  alternatively, the warrants and not es constitute an investment contract in which \ninvestors 1 and 2 invested money and expected to receive profits from palazzo’s efforts in \nconnection with 4ta sports and stack.    \nc. palazzo’s statements to investors 1 and 2 were false.   \n40. palazzo and 4ta sports’ statements to investors 1 and 2 concerning the use of \ninvestor funds and the $5 million in secured funding were material ly false and misleading.  palazzo \nhad no intention of using the funds to “clean up” working capital or ot herwise fund the stack \nacquisition.  palazzo also knew, or  was reckless or negligent in not knowing, that he (1) had not \nsecured $5 million in funds for the stack repurchase and (2) as presented, the $5 million \npromissory note was misleading. \n41. first, as stated above, both investor s wired $250,000 to palazzo-controlled bank \naccounts on october 15, 2019, after palazzo represented that the funds would be used for “working \ncapital” issues related to the stack repurchase.  however, that very same day, palazzo wired the \n$250,000 he received from investor 1 to try to re solve the demand from entity a’s receiver.  this \npayment had nothing to do with “working capital true-ups” or re purchasing stack.  to the \ncontrary, at that time spay had no knowledge of any possible debt owed by stack to entity a, \nnor had palazzo informed spay of any negotiations w ith or payments made to entity a’s receiver.  \nthus, palazzo did not use investor 1’s f unds to secure the stack repurchase.  \n42. then, between october 18, 2019 and february  27, 2020, palazzo used approximately \n$95,000 from investor 2 to repay debts owed to market ing firm b, which are expenses that predate \nspay’s acquisition of stack, and were unknown to spay.  thus, there is no legitimate reason why \npalazzo needed to make this payment prior to closing on the stack repurchase.  palazzo then \nspent another approximately $25,000 from investor 2 to pay his lawy ers in the 2019 civil lawsuit.  \npalazzo then transferred approximately $130,000 of inve stor 2’s funds to a palazzo-controlled bank \naccount held in the name of np vent llc (“np vent”), an account  he primarily uses for personal \nexpenses.  for example, palazzo transferred $9,000 of investor 2’s funds to np vent on or around \nnovember 5, 2019, and then immediately used  these funds to pa y his personal rent. case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 12 of 39  \ncomplaint   \n13  \n  1\n23456789\n1011121314151617181920212223242526272843. palazzo’s immediate misappropriation of inve stor funds demonstrates that he had no \nintention of using the investment s to pursue the stack repurchase.  further, palazzo’s statements \nthat he would use the funds to repurchase stac k were materially misleading because a reasonable \ninvestor would have wanted to know that palazzo intended to use investor funds for debts, \nlitigation, and personal expe nses, rather than the stated busine ss purpose.  indeed, investor 1 has \nstated that his funds being used to stave off li tigation would have been important information for \nhim to know when deciding to invest because he woul d have considered the investment riskier.  he \nfurther stated that he would have been unlikely to  invest had he known that his funds would be used \nfor this purpose.  \n44. second, palazzo knew, or was reckless or ne gligent in not knowing, that he and 4ta \nsports had not secured $5 million in financing fo r the stack repurchase.  palazzo represented to \ninvestors 1 and 2 that the $5 million was “committed” by a “fam ily office,” which investor 1 \nunderstood to mean a privately he ld wealth management firm of  a high-net-worth family or group \nof individuals.  palazzo then sent each invest or a copy of a $5 million promissory note between \n4ta sports and consulting company c.  taken t ogether, palazzo’s representations about the $5 \nmillion funding commitment from c onsulting company c portrayed the investment to investor 1 as \nsomething that was sophisticated, had attracted interest from high-net-wo rth individuals, and was \nsecured by funds from those hi gh-net-worth individuals.  in  truth it was anything but. \n45. for example, palazzo knew that consulting company c was not a family office but \nrather a consulting business run by individual e, a nd palazzo also knew or was reckless or negligent \nin not knowing that consulting company c lacked any realistic ability to provide $5 million in \nfunding.  for example, palazzo knew that consulting company c was not even providing this funding; at best the funding (if it ever came at all) would come from another source or sources \n(potentially media company d) and would be routed  through consulting company c.  palazzo also \nknew that those other sources had not yet provide d any of those funds to consulting company c. \nand palazzo also knew that one of those poten tial funding sources, media company d, was the \nsame source palazzo had been trying (and failing)  to get funding from for about a month.  palazzo \nalso knew that individual e, the signatory on the $5 million promissory note , had separately been case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 13 of 39  \ncomplaint   \n14  \n  1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728trying (and failing) for several months to help pa lazzo raise $1 million to help resolve the claims \nthat resulted in the 2019 civil lawsuit, in which both he and individual e were defendants.  taken \ntogether, palazzo knew, or was reckless or neglig ent in not knowing, that his written and oral \nrepresentations to investors 1 and 2 that he ha d the $5 million in financing and that it was fully \ncommitted, as represented by the $5 million promissory note, were misleading.  further, these \nstatements were materially misl eading because a reasonable investor would have wanted to know \nthat guaranteed funding had not been secured because it rendered their investment riskier.  indeed, \ninvestor 1 indicated that the ex istence of $5 million in committe d financing was important to his \nassessment of the riskiness of the investment. \n46. at a minimum, palazzo misled investors 1 and 2 by representing that he had $5 \nmillion in funding while omitting in formation necessary to make that statement not misleading, \nincluding that the funders of consulting company c had not yet provided the funds. \nd. palazzo’s deceptive “lulling” statements to investor 1.  \n47. both investors 1 and 2 were to be repaid  with interest on october 31, 2019, a mere \ntwo weeks after providing the funds.  knowing he would not repay the inve stors on time (because \nhe had already stolen most of th e investors’ money), palazzo began engaging in “lulling” statements \nto investor 1 a day before repayment was due, when  he assured investor 1 that he was “definitely \nclosing everything this week.”  then, on or around november 11, 2019, palazzo told investor 1: \n“all signs point to this week getting the funds back to you.”  on or around december 24, 2019, \npalazzo told investor 1: “expecting to close on or before 12/31.”  on or around february 12, 2020, \npalazzo told investor 1: “i expect  that we’ll close things out by the end of the month and be able to \ndo the payback soon after.”  appr oximately three months later,  on or around may 29, 2020, palazzo \ntold investor 1: “funds are supposed to be here on monday and then closing.”  then, on or around \njune 16, 2020, palazzo told investor 1: “no funds yet but they are promising by end of this week.”  \nfinally, approximately 10 months after i nvestor 1’s $250,000 wire, on or around august 28, 2020, \npalazzo told investor 1: “i expect some real move ment/negotiation on the deal to happen in the next \nweek or so.” case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 14 of 39  \ncomplaint   \n15  \n  1\n23456789\n1011121314151617181920212223242526272848. investor 1, who was concerne d, also asked palazzo for updates on several occasions.  \non or around november 15, 2019, investor 1 asked pa lazzo if there was “any risk of running out of \n$$ while you are working to close.”  palazzo resp onded: “hey, no risk there, all good on the cash \nflow at the moment.”  then, on or around january 13, 2020, investor 1 asked palazzo: “is cash flow \nokay in the meantime?”  palazzo re sponded: “cash flow is good right  now so no worries there.”   \n49. palazzo knew all of these lulling statements  were false because he had already sent \ninvestor 1’s funds to entity a’s r eceiver.  he therefore knew that he had no intention of using the \nmoney to close the deal with stack. \n50. these lulling statements were designed to  prevent investor 1 from taking any action \nto report palazzo’s conduct, which enabled palazzo to continue defrauding other investors in both \nthe stack and play caller schemes. \n51. to this date, palazzo has not repurchased  stack.  palazzo has also not repaid \ninvestors 1 and 2 any of the principal or interest due on their promissory notes. \n3. palazzo defrauded the owner of a youth sports training center. \n52. after misappropriating almost all of inve stor 1 and 2’s funds, palazzo pitched the \nstack investment to his next  victim (“investor 3”) via telephone in and around march 2020.  \npalazzo was introduced to investor 3 through indi vidual e, who had a mutual connection in the \nsports industry.  during this peri od, investor 3 and her family were in the process of building a \nyouth sports training center.   \n53. after being introduced, palazzo made materia lly misleading statements to investor 3 \nlike those made to investors 1 and 2 to secure an investment.  during these discussions, individual \ne both arranged and was present for phone calls between investor 3 and palazzo and forwarded \nemails from palazzo to investor 3.  in these discussions, palazzo expl ained to investor 3 that he was \nattempting to repurchase stack a nd that he needed to come up with a down payment and the \nremaining funds to finalize the re purchase.  he also explained th at investor 3’s $400,000 investment \nwould act as a “bridge loan” unt il he shortly received the $5 million in funding that media \ncompany d had already committed to provide.  pa lazzo assured investor 3 that her investment \nwould be secured by a $5 million credit placement agreement that 4ta sports had with media case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 15 of 39  \ncomplaint   \n16  \n  1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728company d.  during these same discussions, pa lazzo also pitched that stack would use and \npromote her training center with  professional athletes.   \n54. according to investor 3, she came aw ay from her discussions with palazzo \nunderstanding that her money woul d be used to repurchase stac k, her investment would be \nsecured by the credit placement ag reement, and stack wo uld promote her trai ning center.  based \non this understanding, investor 3 ag reed to make the investment.  palazzo subsequently signed a \npromissory note memorializing the investment, which he asked indivi dual e to send to investor 3. \n55. investor 3’s understanding is confirmed by the deal documentation, which palazzo \nsigned as 4ta sports’ chairman and ceo.  the investment package provided to investor 3 \nincluded a promissory note and a $5 million cred it placement agreement from media company d, \nwhich purported to secure the inve stment.  under the terms of the promissory note, investor 3 was \nentitled to 5% interest on her investment.  the pr incipal and interest on the note were to be paid \napproximately one month later on april 3, 2020.  the credit placement agreement was between \nmedia company d and 4ta sports, signed by palazzo  as the chairman and ceo and dated january \n6, 2020.  the version of the agreement sent to in vestor 3 stated that media company d’s funds \nwould be delivered in march 2020.   \n56. after accepting palazzo’s representations, investor 3 ultimately wired $400,000 to a \n4ta sports bank account on and around march 6, 2020.  \n57. like the promissory notes and warrant ag reements 4ta sports entered into with \ninvestors 1 and 2, this promissory no te is a security, either in the form of a note or an investment \ncontract.    \na. palazzo intentionally deceived investor 3. \n58. palazzo and 4ta sports’ statements to i nvestor 3 concerning the use of her funds \nand the $5 million in secured f unding were materia lly false and misleading.  palazzo had no \nintention of using the funds to repurchase stac k.  further, palazzo knew, or was reckless or \nnegligent in not knowing, that (1) he had not secured $5 million in  funds for the stack repurchase \nand (2) as presented, the $5 million credit  placement agreement was misleading. case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 16 of 39  \ncomplaint   \n17  \n  1\n23456789\n1011121314151617181920212223242526272859. palazzo never intended to use investor 3’s funds to repurchase stack.  as stated \nabove, investor 3 wired the $400,000 on march 6, 2020, believing the funds would be used for the \nstack repurchase.  however, that very same day, palazzo began a series of transfers that \neventually totaled $68,000 to the np vent account, wh ich he primarily used fo r personal expenses.  \nmoreover, beginning that very same  day and continuing into later th at month, palazzo wired a total \nof $75,000 he received from investor 3 to repay his de bt to marketing firm b.  palazzo also wired \n$15,000 to pay his lawyers in the 2019 civil lawsuit.   palazzo’s use of in vestor 3’s funds for \npersonal expenses, legal expenses, and an unrelated lawsuit are misappropriation.   \n60. then, on april 8—after investor 3’s pro missory note was due for payment—palazzo \nwired $180,000 through three stack bank accounts that he controlled before ultimately wiring the \nmoney to spay on the same day.  palazzo testified that this payment was a necessary part of the \nrepurchase process.  but, according to an spay repr esentative, spay’s controller periodically asked \nif palazzo’s stack unit was generating cash and, if so, to direct it to be sent to the parent \ncompany.  moreover, spay described the purpose of  this $180,000 payment in a balance sheet entry \nas “a net cash payment and reduce old stack receivable .”  thus, palazzo sent this payment to spay \npursuant to stack’s normal operating agreements and to lead spay to believe that stack was \ngenerating cash.  further, during this period, spa y and palazzo were not in active negotiations \nbecause spay had paused the negotiations to investigate palazzo’s knowledge of stack’s \npurported debts to entity a.  and, indeed, spay fire d palazzo two days after this payment transfer.  \nthus, this payment had nothing to do with repurchasing stack.   \n61. palazzo’s immediate misappropriation of inve stor 3’s funds shows that he never had \nany intention of using her investment to pursue the stack repurchase.  further, his statements \nwere materially misleading because  a reasonable investor would ha ve wanted to know that palazzo \nintended to use investor funds fo r stack’s debts and palazzo’s pers onal and legal ex penses; rather \nthan, the stated business purpose.  indeed, investor 3 has stated that  she would not have invested if \nshe knew that palazzo was going to use the funds for pers onal expenses.  \n62. moreover, palazzo’s misappropriation here comes after he had already \nmisappropriated nearly $500,000 raised from other inve stors.  his previous misappropriation of case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 17 of 39  \ncomplaint   \n18  \n  1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728investor 1 and 2’s funds further de monstrates that at the time he solicited funds from investor 3, he \ndid so knowing that he planned to use the funds for his personal benefit and not to advance the \nstack repurchase.  \n63. palazzo knew, or was reckless or negligent in not knowing, that he and 4ta sports \nhad provided a credit placement agreement to invest or 3, which would never be funded.  according \nto the agreement, 4ta sports was supposed to receive the $5 million fro m media company d in \nmarch 2020.  in reality, palazzo had entered into an identical credit placement agreement with \nmedia company d in september 2019 and was suppos ed to receive the funds  that month.  media \ncompany d never provided the funds.  yet, after months of not receiving the $5 million, palazzo \nasked media company d’s managing director to sign a new agreemen t in january 2020, stating: “i \ncan’t show the old agreement to my funding source.  i need something recent .”  palazzo asked the \nmanaging director to sign yet another new version in  in late february 2020 a nd a follow-up letter in \nearly march, prompting palazzo to  send an email stating: “hopeful ly this helps us get something \nclosed!”  these emails demonstrate that palazzo knew, or was reckless or negligent in not knowing, \nthat the $5 million credit placement ag reement was simply a ruse to obtain money from investor 3, \nand that there was never any true  intention of the credit placem ent agreement actually funding.  \nindeed, the credit placement agreement that pa lazzo provided to investor 3 never funded.   \n64. taken together, palazzo knew that his repr esentations to inve stor 3 about the $5 \nmillion credit placement agreement were false.  further, these statements were materially \nmisleading because a reasonable investor would ha ve wanted to know that the collateral for the \npromissory note had not been secure d because it rendered their investment riskier.  indeed, investor \n3 has stated that she ultimately invested because  the credit placement agreem ent convinced her that \nher investment was safe. \n65. palazzo has not repaid investor 3 any of  the principal or interest due on her \npromissory note.  when contacted by investor 3, pa lazzo continues to claim that he does not have \nthe funds to repay her.  palazzo has never informed  investor 3 that he spent her investment on debts \nand personal and legal expenses.   case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1

march 2020, palazzo received \n$900,000 to repurchase stack through promissory notes  between 4ta sports and investors 1, 2, \nand 3.  during this same period, 4ta sports had no source of funds other than this $900,000.  \npalazzo misappropriated nearly all $900,000, using the funds for prior debts, transfers to the np \nvent account, and litigation expens es unrelated to palazzo’s effo rts to repurchase stack.  the \nbelow chart breaks down the specif ic use of the investor funds. \ncategory amount percentage \nentit y a settlement and pa yments $265,000 29.4% \ntransfers to np vent

misappropriating \ninvestor funds, palazzo knew, or was reckless or negligent in not knowing, that his statements to \ninvestors were materially  false and misleading.  he also knew, or was reckless or negligent in not \nknowing, that his misappropr iation of funds acted, or would act , as a fraud or deceit upon these \nsame investors.  because palazzo was the ceo a nd sole shareholder of 4ta sports and acted on \nbehalf of 4ta sports when signing the notes and i nvestment contracts discu ssed above, his scienter \nand negligence imputes to 4ta sports.  addition ally, because palazzo managed 4ta sports on a \nday-to-day basis, negotiated the notes and investment  contracts at issue, an d controlled the financial case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 19 of 39

20(a) of the exchange act. \n68. the sec has recently received information that, within the past three months, \npalazzo may have re-victimized investors 2 and 3 by inducing them to sign amendments to the \npromissory notes described above that supposedly convert the funds  owed to the investors into \nequity in yet another palazzo business venture.  investor 1 received a similar solicitation from \npalazzo but has not signed an amendment to his agreements with palazzo and 4ta sports.  when \nsoliciting investor 1 to sign these amendments, palazzo omitted any reference to how he had \npreviously used investor 1’s funds .  that omission rendered materi ally misleading statements that \npalazzo made to investor 1 in the new solicit ation, including that the new business was “an \nopportunity to reorganize and am end your current outstanding 4ta sports note to facilitate \nrepayment and provide appropriate  collateral.”  based on the doc uments the sec has presently \nobtained regarding the solicitations of investors 2 and 3, it appears that pa lazzo similarly omitted \nhis misappropriation of funds when  recently soliciting them, which rendered similar statements to \nthem materially misleadi ng.  the sec is continuing to assess these new developments.  however, \npalazzo’s misleading efforts to have  investors sign amendments to their prior agreements, including \nrepresentations that these amendmen ts are a way for investors to obt ain repayment, are part of his \nscheme to conceal from them his inten tional misappropriation of their funds. \nc. palazzo, np ventures, and play caller fr audulently raised approximately $2.1 \nmillion from investors by misrepresent ing that the investments would fund \nthe development of a sports betting application. 1. overview of the play caller scheme.\n \n69. with the ink barely dry on investor 3’s pr omissory note, palazzo pivoted and formed \nnp ventures in april 2020 and play caller in may 2020.  palazzo testified that np ventures is an \noperating company that supports new companies crea ted by him, including play caller.  at all \nrelevant times, palazzo was the ceo and majority  shareholder of np ventures; np ventures was \nthe majority shareholder of play caller; and palazzo served as ceo of play caller.  play caller case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 20

ngagement experiences. \n70. after forming np ventures and play ca ller, palazzo commenced the play caller \nscheme in september 2020.  from september 2020 until december 2023, palazzo raised more than \n$2.1 million from at least 22 investors through play  caller and np ventures, representing that \ninvestor funds would be used to develop and la unch the play caller m obile application through \nwhich players could bet on the next  play in a live sports game (t he “play caller app”).  instead, \nhowever, palazzo misappropriated more than 75 per cent of these investor funds to pay undisclosed \ndebts, litigation fees, personal expenses, including vacations to disneyland and hilton head island, \nsouth carolina, and consulti ng fees to himself.   \n71. the $2.1 million raised consisted of appr oximately $1 million in np ventures \ninvestments from 5 investors a nd approximately $1.1 million in play caller investments from \napproximately 17 investors.  all but one investor’s inve stments were memoria lized in convertible \npromissory notes with np ventur es or play caller.  one conver tible promissory note purported to \npay 15% interest; the rest pur ported to pay 6% interest.  \n72. the play caller and np ventures convertib le promissory notes are securities.  \nindeed, most of the notes discus sed below state on their face that they are securities subject to \ncertain transfer restrictions under the federal securi ties laws.  additionally, th ey are interest-bearing \nand can convert into equity secu rities.  alternativel y, they are also investment contracts under \nwhich each similarly-situated vict im invested money (which was th en pooled together) with the \nexpectation of profits from palazzo’s efforts.   \n2. palazzo misappropriated investor money.  \n73. palazzo, through np ventures and play caller , approached at least 22 investors.  in \nmany instances, palazzo emailed and often spoke with investors using pitch decks that he drafted.  \npalazzo represented to each investor discussed below that their investment would be used to \ndevelop the play caller app.  however, in each instance, palazzo misappropriated the \noverwhelming majority of funds for his personal use.  his specific materially mislead ing statements case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 21 of 39  \ncomplaint   \n22  \n

defrauded a group of eight investors—twice. \ni. the first fraudulent offering to  the dallas investor group. \n74. on or around november 11, 2020, palazzo pitched a group of eight dallas-area \ninvestors (the “dallas investor group”) on a play caller investme nt through an in-person meeting \nand presentation.  according to a member of the dallas investor  group (“investor 4”), palazzo \nrepresented to the group that thei r investment funds would be us ed to pay software engineers \nworking on the play caller app.  he also represen ted that the play caller app would be launching \nin january 2021, just in time  for the nfl playoffs.   \n75. further, palazzo’s presentation included a slide titled “use of funds.”  that slide \nstated that a $500,000 investment wo uld allow play caller to (1) “s ecure key data, engineering and \nmanagement talent”; (2) “execute against [strat egic distribution] partne rship to bring api to \nsportsbook market”; and (3) “dev elop first ‘free to play’ game  in partnership with major \ntelecommunications partner/s.”  pa lazzo also represented that his salary would be limited to $20,833 \nper month and sent a spreadsheet indicating that his salary would represent a relatively small \nportion of play caller’s overall expenses. \n76. after this meeting, in december 2020, th e members of the dallas investor group \ncollectively invested $50 0,000 in the play caller offering.  ea ch investor’s investment was \nmemorialized in a convertible pr omissory note with play caller  and had a maturity date of \ndecember 28, 2022.  \n77. after obtaining the dallas investor group’s funds in december 2020, palazzo \nwasted no time in putting them to his personal use.  indeed, that month, palazzo used approximately \n$19,000 of the funds to pay legal fees related to  the 2019 civil lawsuit.  then, in january 2021, \npalazzo spent $235,000 of the $500,000 investment to settle the 2019 civil lawsuit.  further, \nbetween december 2020 and march 2021, palazzo spen t approximately $54,000 to repay part of his \noutstanding debt to marketing fi rm b.  palazzo also used approximately $21,000 of the dallas \ninvestor group’s funds to pay a company that removes negative  information fro m individuals’ case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 22 of 39  \ncomplaint   \n23  \n

he primarily used for person al expenses.  palazzo \nhad exhausted the entire $500,000 investment by around april 6, 2021.  in total, palazzo and play \ncaller spent less than ten percent of the dallas investor group’s f unds on play caller’s software \nengineers and other devel opment personnel.     \n78. thus, despite palazzo’s representations that  his salary would represent a relatively \nsmall portion of play caller’s ove rall expenses, he subsequently spent approximately 80% of the \ndallas investor group’s funds for hi s personal use, as shown in the chart below.  during the period \nfrom december 2020 through march 2021, play caller had no source of funds other than the \n$500,000 from the dallas investment group.  for purposes  of this chart, “per sonal use” includes

statements that he intended to  use the dallas investor group’s funds on \ndeveloping the play caller app we re thus materially misleading because a reasonable investor \nwould have wanted to know that their funds were not being used for their intended business \npurpose.  indeed, investor 4 has stated that he would not have invested if he knew palazzo was \nusing his investment on legal settleme nts and other personal expenses.  \nii. the second fraudulent offering to  the dallas investor group.  \n80. in december 2022, the eight notes came due, and palazzo made lulling statements \nthat not only prevented members of  the dallas investor group fro m complaining about his actions, \nbut also fraudulently convinced all of them to roll their investment  forward into new notes.    case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 23 of 39  \ncomplaint   \n24  \n  1\n23456789\n1011121314151617181920212223242526272881. for instance, on or around november 8, 2022, investor 4 emailed palazzo ahead of \nthe notes’ maturity date of december 28, 2022.  inve stor 4 asked palazzo fo r the play caller app’s \nstatus and play caller’s balance sheets and income statements.   \n82. palazzo responded the next day, attaching in come statements and a balance sheet.  \nthe income statements showed that play caller had $50,966 in tota l expenses in each month of \n2021, with $37,781 spent on “product, technology & te am expenses,” $2,000 spent on “software & \napplication expenses,” and $11,175 on “other product & dev expenses.”  the balance sheet showed \nthat play caller had $10,409 in cash and cash equivalents in oc tober 2021 and $158,224 in cash and \ncash equivalents as of december 2021.  these statements were false. \n83. for example, the statement that play  caller spent only $50,966 in january 2021 was \nfalse.  play caller spent $235,000 on the 2019 civil lawsuit alone in january 2021, and also had \nother expenses.  the statement that play caller spent only $50,966 in july 2021 was similarly false.  \nin july 2021, palazzo had used another play ca ller investor’s funds to  pay more than $60,000 in \nrent and a security depos it for a multi-million-do llar home, currently valu ed at over $5 million, for \nhim and his family. \n84. additionally, play caller did not have cash and cash equivalents of $10,409 in \noctober 2021 and $158,224 in december 2021.  accord ing to play caller’s bank records, in \noctober 2021, the company had a beginning balance of $10 in its  bank account and an ending \nbalance of $30.  in december 2021, the compa ny had a beginning bala nce of $18.25 in its bank \naccount and an ending balance of $19.25.  the co mpany had similarly lo w funds from september \nthrough december 2021. \n85. as the sole signatory to the play caller  bank account, palazzo had full control and \nknew play caller’s expenditures and cash on hand.  his bald-faced falsities were an attempt to \ncover up his misappropriation of funds. \n86. palazzo’s deception resulted in six of th e investors agreeing to roll their notes \nforward another year while the ot her two investors rolled their not es forward to february 2023.  all \neight extensions were memorialized in amended promissory notes executed by palazzo, acting on case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 24 of 39  \ncomplaint   \n25  \n

repaid any investors in the dallas investor group any of the \nprincipal or interest due on thei r convertible promissory notes. \nb. palazzo defrauded a former professional athlete.  \n88. having exhausted the dallas investor gr oup’s funds, palazzo moved on to new \ntargets of opportunity.  on or around june 8, 2021, palazzo sent a play caller presentation to a \nformer professional athlete and an  employee at a venture capital firm  affiliated with the athlete.  \napproximately one month later, on or around july 16, 2021, palazzo received a $100,000 \ninvestment in play caller from the venture capital firm (“investor 5”).  this investment was \nmemorialized in a convertible pr omissory note with play caller  and had a maturity date of \ndecember 2022. \n89. in the presentation, palazzo represented th at play caller was “raising capital to \nexecute against specific product de velopment targets for the next 12 months to bring its proprietary \nengine and games to market through strategic partnerships .”  this was not true.  \n90. to the contrary, the very day that palazzo  and play caller received investor 5’s \nfunds, palazzo began transferring money from the pl ay caller bank account to np ventures’ bank \naccount.  then, of the $85,000 in funds transferred to np ventures between july 16, 2021, and july \n27, 2021, palazzo spent more than $60,000 on a security deposit and the first three months’ rent for \nhis family’s new multi-million-dol lar rental home.  he spent another $8,000 on moving expenses \nand $5,000 on litigation expenses unrelated to play  caller.  palazzo tran sferred the remaining \napproximately $13,000 of investor 5’s money from  a play caller bank acc ount to the np vent \naccount.  of those funds, palazzo spent approxim ately $9,000 on rent for his previous rental home \nand $1,200 on credit card payments.   \n91. in total, palazzo spent less than $2,500 of  investor 5’s money on business expenses \nof play caller.  palazzo has not  repaid investor 5 any of the principal or interest due on its \nconvertible promissory note. case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 25 of 39  \ncomplaint   \n26  \n

28, 2022, palazzo sent a manager of a gaming industry advisory  firm a play caller \npresentation.  a few weeks later, on or around ma rch 17, 2022, the gaming industry advisory firm \n(“investor 6”) invested $100,000 in play caller.  investor 6’s investment was memorialized in a \nconvertible promissory note w ith play caller and had a matu rity date of february 2023. \n93. in the presentation, palazzo represented that  play caller “plans to raise capital to \nexecute specific product developm ent goals, including integration of  web3 elements, to bring its \nplatform to market generating revenues through licensing and real -money competitions.”  once \nagain, this was not true.  instead, palazzo again misappropriated investor funds to subsidize his \nlifestyle.  \n94. indeed, shortly after receiving investor 6’s funds, in apr il 2022, palazzo spent \napproximately $10,000 at the mandalay bay resort  & casino in las vegas and approximately \n$4,200 on airfare.  between march 17 and april 26, 2022, he transferred more  than $60,000 to the \nnp ventures account.  he used those funds to spend $12,250 on personal rent, more than $5,000 on \nhis children’s private school and daycare, and more than $20,000 on other personal expenses, \nincluding car payments, dental e xpenses, and purchases at a pool  supply store.  he withdrew \nanother approximately $4,200 in cash and transferred at least $8,800 to the np vent account, \nwhich he used primarily for personal expenses.  \n95. in total, palazzo spent less than $20,000 of investor 6’s money on play caller’s \nbusiness expenses.  palazzo has not  repaid investor 6 any of the principal or interest due on its \nconvertible promissory note. \nd. palazzo defrauded a navy veteran.  \n96. unfortunately, palazzo also targeted as one of his victims an 89 -year-old who served \nin the united states navy and ot her government roles before starti ng an investing career (“investor \n7”).  between december 2020 and august 2023, invest or 7 sent palazzo and np ventures $500,000 \nacross 12 investments.  i nvestor 7’s investments were memoriali zed in convertible promissory notes \nwith np ventures and had maturity dates between december 6, 2021, and october 31, 2023.   case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 26 of 39  \ncomplaint   \n27  \n  1\n23456789\n1011121314151617181920212223242526272897. palazzo testified that he told investor 7 that his funds would be used to support the \ncontinued development of play caller.  documents provided to investor 7, in cluding a presentation \nthat palazzo sent investor 7, i ndicate that palazzo solicited mone y from investor 7 by referencing \nboth play caller and stack.  for example, in  or around august 2020, palazzo sent investor 7 a \ndocument which states: “np [ventu res] plans to raise $500,000 ($500k) in seed capital to launch.  \nfunds will be used to launch the play caller/4ta sports businesses and support the buyback of certain assets of stack media, my previous co mpany, that are highly syne rgistic.”  investor 7 \nsubsequently began investing with pal azzo, sending him $100,000 on december 7, 2020, and \nultimately investing approximately $500,000 th rough a dozen notes between december 2020 and \nseptember 2023.  though investor 7 may have invested in bot h the play caller and stack \nopportunities, palazzo used little of  investor 7’s funds on either inve stment.  to the contrary, of the \n$500,000, palazzo misappropriated at least $450,000 by, for instance, using the funds to pay for \nmultiple vacations, including a trip to disn eyland.  for instance, on or around june 22, 2022, \ninvestor 7 made a $100,000 investme nt.  starting the next day, a nd continuing to around june 27, \n2022, palazzo spent approximately $4,000 during a pers onal trip to lake tahoe.  palazzo spent at \nleast $5,000 on another personal trip to hilton head island in late july 2022.  additionally, palazzo \nused investor 7’s funds for various other person al expenses, including personal rent, car payments, \ncredit card payments, dental expenses, sports and fitness expenses, his children’s daycare and \nprivate school expenses, and si gnificant cash withdrawals.  \n98. moreover, throughout 2023, palazzo made severa l “lulling” statements to investor 7 \nthat were designed to both give i nvestor 7 a false sense of security  and operated as new frauds that \nconvinced investor 7 to i nvest additional funds.   \n99. for instance, on or around april 20, 2023, palazzo wrote to investor 7: “finally, and \nplease know that i am embarrassed to ask and bo ther you, but i wondered gi ven the timing of the \n[new] capital coming in next mont h, if you would be able to he lp with one final $25k bridge \ninvestment to help us get th rough until their capital ar rives?”  investor 7 provided $25,000 on or \naround april 21, 2023.  yet, there is  no indication that palazzo ha d new capital lined up or was case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 27 of 39  \ncomplaint   \n28  \n  1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728spending money to develop the play caller app.  indeed, palazzo received no additional capital \nuntil he convinced investor 7 to provide him with another $25,000 on or around may 25, 2023.    \n100. between april and august 2023, palazzo contin ued this same pattern of “lulling” \nstatements followed by new fraudulent requests for additional investme nts.  each time, investor 7 \nprovided palazzo and np ventures with more fund s in exchange for a new promissory note signed \nby palazzo on behalf of np ventures. \n101. in total, palazzo and np ventures spen t less than $55,000 of investor 7’s funds on \nbusiness expenses.  palazzo has not  repaid investor 7 any of the principal or interest due on his \nconvertible promissory notes.  on information and be lief, investor 7 still tr usts palazzo and despite \nthe efforts of the sec staff to reach out to him, investor 7 is unaware that  he has been defrauded. \ne. palazzo defrauded a senior care coordinator. \n102. after years of misleading investors and mis appropriating funds, palazzo’s scheme \nwas still continuing in late 2023—even after palazz o became aware of the sec’s investigation.  on \nor around september 28, 2023, palazzo or ally represented to a senior  care coordinator that her \ninvestment would be used to ma rket the launch of play caller.   on or around september 28, 2023, \npalazzo received a $100,000 investment from an en tity (“investor 8”) th at the senior care \ncoordinator formed with a realtor.  this investment was memori alized in a convertible promissory \nnote with play caller and has a ma turity date of september 21, 2024. \n103. palazzo did not use investor 8’s funds for ma rketing play caller.  indeed, play caller \ndid not even launch a version of the app until after palazzo exhausted investor 8’s funds.  instead, palazzo spent approximately $46,400 at a san fr ancisco jeweler, another $9,500 on personal rent, \napproximately $5,000 on airfare, and more than $ 9,000 on other personal expenses, including a trip \nto hilton head island.   \n104. in total, palazzo and play caller spent le ss than $14,000 of investor 8’s funds on any \nbusiness expenses.  palazzo has not  repaid investor 8 any of the principal or interest due on its \nconvertible promissory note. \n105. each of the above statements made by pal azzo, in his capacity as ceo and chairman \nof np ventures and play caller, were material ly misleading because a reasonable investor would case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 28 of 39  \ncomplaint   \n29  \n  1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728have wanted to know that palazzo did not intend to use their funds to develop play caller’s app but \nrather to fund his lavish lifest yle, legal settlements, and othe r personal expenses.  and, indeed, \nseveral of the play caller investor s listed above have stated that they would not have invested if \nthey knew their funds would be used  for palazzo’s personal expenses. \n3. palazzo misappropriated play caller investor funds.  \n106. between september 2020 and december 2023, palazzo received approximately $2.1 \nmillion to develop his play caller business, primarily through convert ible promissory notes between \ninvestors and play caller or np ventures.  play caller and np ventures received a limited amount \nof non-investor funds during that time, includ ing consulting income earned by palazzo and \npalazzo’s own funds.  play caller received approximately $125,000 from non-investor sources, while np ventures received approximate ly $157,000 from non-investor sources.   \n107. a breakdown of how palazzo spent the combined play caller and np ventures \ninvestors’ funds appears below.  for purposes of this chart, to the extent play caller and np \nventures had non-investor sources of funds, the sec has (favorably to  the defendants) first credited \npersonal expenses against those non -investor funds, and what is s hown below is how investor funds \nwere used.  \nnp venture and play caller

\nmisleadingly described as his salary to the dall as investor group, he st ill misappropriated more \nthan 75% of investor funds. case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 29 of 39  \ncomplaint   \n30  \n  1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728109. because he was the person both making th e statements above and misappropriating \ninvestor funds, palazzo knew, or was reckless or negligent in not knowing, that his statements to \ninvestors were materially  false and misleading.  he also knew, or was reckless or negligent in not \nknowing, that his misappropr iation of funds acted, or would act , as a fraud or deceit upon these \nsame investors.  because palazzo was the ceo a nd controlling shareholder of both play caller and \nnp ventures, and acted on behalf of play caller and/or  np ventures when signing the promissory \nnotes discussed above, his scienter and negligence is imputed to play caller and np ventures.  \nadditionally, because palazzo managed both play ca ller and np ventures on a day-to-day basis, \nnegotiated the promissory notes at issue, and co ntrolled the financial e xpenditures for both play \ncaller and np ventures throughout this period, he is  a control person within the meaning of section \n20(a) of the exchange act. \n4. palazzo attempted to paper over his fraud through his substantial \nconsulting payments and loans to himself.  \n110. as palazzo kicked off the play call er offering, in or around september 2020, \npalazzo entered into separate consulting agreemen ts with play caller and np ventures.  each \nagreement was structured to pay entities co ntrolled by palazzo $20,000 per month in purported \n“consulting fees” (through np vent or np ventures).  palazzo, as the chairman and ceo of each \nentity, is the lone signatory on each agreement.  the terms of these agreements provided entities \ncontrolled by palazzo total annual consu lting fees of $480,000.  between 2020 and 2023, palazzo \ntransferred approximately $1 million in investor  funds to himself (t hrough np vent or np \nventures) pursuant to these agreements, which he used primarily for personal expenses, legal \nsettlements, and litigation expenses.  in c ontrast, palazzo spent le ss than $350,000 on developing \nthe play caller app.  palazzo did not disclose the consulting agreements nor the extent of his \n“compensation” to investors excep t for the misleading disclosure s to the dallas investor group \ndescribed above in paragraphs 74-75, 77-79, and the misleading disclosu re to investor 6 and others \ndiscussed in paragraph 113 below.  \n111. on top of consulting fees, palazzo also pa id personal expenses and unrelated debts \nand litigation expenses directly out of play caller and np ve ntures’ bank accounts.  indeed, case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 30 of 39  \ncomplaint   \n31  \n  1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728palazzo testified that he paid his personal e xpenses out of these bank accounts and that, on a \nmonthly basis, he performed a reconciliation allo cating each personal expense as either: (1) expense \nreimbursement, (2) consulting fees, or (3) loans to  himself.  at the end of each year, palazzo \npapered over his theft of investor funds by executi ng a note for the amount he  had “loaned” himself \nduring the year.  as of january 2024, there we re four outstanding not es:  a $170,000 note for 2020, \na $145,000 note for 2021, a $210,000 note for 2022, and a $184,000 note for 2023, for a total of $709,000.  each note has a five-year term, and palazzo has not made any payments of principal or \ninterest under the notes back to the companies.   again, palazzo has acknowledged that he never \nrevealed these “loans” to his investors.  \n112. even if palazzo was entitled to some sala ry or consulting fees  for his efforts, \nomitting that he was going to spend more than 80% of investor funds on his salary, personal \nexpenses, unrelated legal settlements, and unrelat ed legal expenses and a mere 20% of investor \nfunds on engineering and other deve lopment expenses rendered the st atements he made about using \ninvestor funds to develop the play caller app mate rially misleading.  furthe r, in pitch decks to \nseveral investors, including to investor 5, he made specific repr esentations that the money would \nnot only be used to build the play caller app, but th at it would be used to ex ecute against a list of \nspecific product development targets.  however,  palazzo spent nearly all of investor 5’s $100,000 \ninvestment on consulting fees to entities he controlled, more than  75% of which ultimately went \ntoward palazzo’s personal rent, security de posit, and moving expenses.  thus, palazzo’s \nrepresentations to investor 5 were false and misleading.   \n113. additionally, in pitch decks to investor 6 and two othe r investors not individually \ndiscussed in this complaint, palazzo disclosed projected payroll relate d expenses, along with \nprojections for millions in reve nue, profits, operating income, and expenses.  all these projections \nwere built on the premise that play caller w ould be an operating company with revenue and \nexpenses.  however, from may 22, 2020 to dece mber 31, 2023, play caller had no significant \nsource of income or revenue—virtually  all of its funds appeared to be  investor funds or funds from \npalazzo or palazzo-affiliated entities.  thus, palazzo  omitting to tell investor 6 and other investors \nthat he intended to use approximately 80% of their investment on person al and other non-business case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 31 of 39  \ncomplaint   \n32  \n  1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728expenses and a mere 20% on operating expenses, including investment on engineering and other \ndevelopment expenses rendered hi s disclosures concerning payroll related expenses materially \nmisleading.  \n114. nor can palazzo claim that his consulting f ees were reasonable, and investors should \nhave contemplated that he woul d need a salary.  to the contra ry, palazzo’s representations to \ninvestors through, for instance, payroll projections that he provided in his pitch decks clearly \ncontemplated an operating business, with a growing payroll, devoted to deve loping the play caller \napp, and not a founder using the overwhelming majo rity of investor money as his own personal \nslush fund, which he then used to  bankroll his living expenses.  \n115. for example, the pitch deck that palazzo drafted and provided to  the dallas investor \ngroup prior to their $500,000 investment disclosed that palazzo would receive a $250,000 salary in \n2021, representing approximately 5% of play caller’s planned expenditures for that year.  however, \nnowhere in the slide deck or ot her communications did palazzo disclose that he would use their \ninvestment to settle a civil lawsuit, pay outsta nding debts, and on other personal expenses.  in any \nevent, he spent approximately $530,000—inc luding approximately $400,000 from the dallas \ninvestor group—on non-business expenses in 2021, wh ich was not only well in excess of palazzo’s \ndisclosed $250,000 salary but represented over 75% pe rcent of play caller’s actual expenses for \n2021.  \n116. given palazzo’s repeated stat ements to investors that th eir funds would be used to \ndevelop the play caller app, his use of $1.7 million on himself or  to pay debts and litigation \nexpenses unrelated to play ca ller, and less than $350,000 on devel oping play caller, rendered his \nstatements materially false and misleading.  the consulti ng agreements and loans were not \nlegitimate payments for business ope rations, but a cover-up and part of  palazzo’s overall deliberate \nscheme to steal investor funds. \n117. the sec has recently received information that  within the past three months palazzo \nmay have sought to re-victimize numerous np ve ntures and play caller investors by soliciting \nthem to sign amendments to th e notes described above in excha nge for equity in np ventures, \nand/or play caller warrants.  as  with the 4ta sports amendments  discussed above, the documents case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 32 of 39  \ncomplaint   \n33  \n  1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728the sec has received indicate that palazzo omitted any mention of his past use of investor funds \nwhen soliciting these amendments, and that o mission rendered materially misleading palazzo’s \nstatements to the investors such as “i will also be personally guaranteeing any outstanding \npromissory notes in np ventures. it is important that i do all i can to help each investor earn a \nstrong return, while also providing additional secu rity for the notes, espe cially because we had \nhoped to pay them back already.”  as with the recent solic itations of the 4ta sports investors, the \nsec is continuing to assess these new developments .  however, palazzo’s misleading efforts to \nhave investors sign amendments to their prior agreements, including representations that these \namendments are a way for investors to obtain repa yment, are part of his scheme to conceal from \nthem his intentional misappr opriation of their funds. \n118. in total, across both the stack scheme  and the play caller scheme, palazzo, \nthrough the corporate defendants, received appr oximately $3,065,000 in investor funds between \noctober 2019 and december 2023.  palazzo has spen t more than $1 million on consulting fees to \nhimself.  he has spent another $1.1 million on unrela ted past business debts and litigation expenses \nand $400,000 on personal expenses beyond the consulting fe es to himself.  this misappropriation of \ninvestor funds, combined with how palazzo often misappropriated investor funds immediately after \nreceiving them, demonstrates that these schemes were not legitimate businesses that failed, but \nintentional schemes by which palazzo sought to de fraud people, including his friends, in order to \nenrich himself.  \nclaims for relief \nfirst claim for relief \nviolations of exchange act sect ion 10(b) and rule 10b-5 thereunder \n(all defendants) \n119. the sec re-alleges and incorporates by

(“caastle”)  – created and disseminated  to investors false financial \nstatements while raising  more than $ 250 million for caastle through the offer and sale of preferred \nstock  and common warrants.  \n2. hunsicker’s fake financials supported her narrative that caastle, a startup that \noffered a new monetization model called “clothing -as-a-service” to the apparel industry , enjoyed \nrapid and steady revenue growth after a rebrand of the business in 2018, achieved profitability by \ndecember 2022, experienced exponential increases in profitability thereafter, and was nearing an \ninitial public offering or sale . in reality, caastle’s revenues were shrinking, its losses were \nincreasing , and the company was never profitable.  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 1 of 32  \n2 3. throughout the relevant period, not a single existing or prospective caastle \ninvestor received accurate monthly, quarterly, or annual caastle financial statements from \nhunsicker .  \n4. to effect her scheme, hunsicker took financial reports that she received every \nmonth from her financial team and created an alternate set of financials with false monthly, \nquarterly, and annual results that supported her narrative  of the company’s success. she provided \nthese falsified financial statements to investors upon request.   \n5. by 2022, as caastle appeared to be close to reaching profitability, investors \nincreasingly began to ask for audit ed financial  statements . to maintain her ruse, hunsicker took \ncaastle’s final signed audit report for fiscal year ended september 30, 2021, downloaded it to her \ncomputer, altered the numbers, removed the going concern statement in the audit opinion letter , \nand provided the falsified audit to investors . after caastle’s long -time auditor terminated its \nrelationship with caastle in 2023, hunsicker created her own a udit reports . she falsified  the \nnumbers, audit opinion letter s, and notes  for the reports covering fiscal year s ended sept ember 30, \n2022 and 2023, and she forged the former auditor’s signature . \n6. beginning in 2022, hunsicker  also hid from investors  the extent to which caastle \ncontinued to rely on primary capital raises to fund its operations , and she provided capitalization \ntables that undercounted the number of issued and outstanding shares and that misled investors \nabout caastle’s true capital stru cture. many investors believed that, using caastle as a middleman, \nthey were indirectly  purchasing discounted shares in secondary transactions from founders, \nemployees, and others who needed liquidity for various personal reasons . typically, however, \nthese investors were purchasing original i ssue shares directly from caastle . each caastle investor \nowned a smaller percentage of the company than they realized.  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 2 of 32  \n3 7. occasionally, hunsicker herself was the undisclosed seller  in secondary \ntransaction s, and  received for her preferred shares the price at which caastle was selling shares in \nits then -current funding round, not the negotiated discounted price . in other words, hunsicker \norchestrated transactions in which she benefitted herself at the company’s and investors’ expense .  \n8. hunsicker’s scheme began to unravel  in late 2024, when multiple investors \nreviewed caastle’s falsified 2 023 audit report in hunsicker’s office  and noticed a missing page \nand several  errors inconsistent with the presented document  being a final audit report . an investor  \ncontacted  the audit firm whose name hunsicker had forged on the report . the firm told the investor \nthat they had not been caa stle’s auditor for years .  \n9. hunsicker w as forced to resign from caastle’s board of directors on december \n14, 2024. but s he was temporarily allowed to remain as caast le’s ceo, with restrictions , \nincluding an outright prohibition on her ability to fundraise for caastle and sign  contracts. \ninvestors were not informed of hunsicker’s actions or departure from the board while the board \nconducted an internal investigation.   \n10. hunsicker’s wrongdoing continued. between december 14, 2024 and march 24, \n2025, hunsicker circumvented the board’s restrictions , provided old and new falsified financial \nstatements to caas tle investors, including for fiscal -year ended september 30, 2024, and engaged \nin self -dealing transactions in which, among other things, she sold approximately $10 million of \nher personal shares of caas tle to existing investors that were unaware of her fraud .  \n11. hunsicker  formally resigned from her position as ceo on march 24,  2025. the \ncompany began

connection with her \ncapital -raising efforts for caastle .  \n34. hunsicker provided materially false financial statements to investors for \napproximately 6 years , during which time caastle raised more than $ 250 million in capital from \ninvestors who were unaware that the financial information they received was entirely a fiction .  \n35. throughout that time, investors routinely asked for financial statements as part of \ntheir original and continuing due diligence on the company. some required financial statements \nbecause their own financial statements were  audited and their auditors needed to value their \nholdings in caastle. accurate financial statements were important to investors .  \n36. as alleged in further detail  below, i n early 2019, hunsicker’s falsified financial \nstatements for fiscal year ended september 30, 2018, reported gross annual revenues of $71.5 \nmillion, a 187% inflation of caastle’s actual gross revenues, which were $24.9 million. the \ndiscrepancy between hunsicker’s misstated financial results and the company’s actual results continued to grow in magnitude year-over- year, as reflected in the below chart:   case 1:25-cv-05897

($55.8)  ($81) ($59)  \n \n37. at all times, hunsicker was the sole caastle employee to communicate with and \nprovide financial information to investors . her finance team, including caastle’s head of finance \nand financial controller, did not provide financial statements to investors.  \ni. hunsicker falsified caastle’s fiscal 2018 financials  \n38. by no later than january 22, 2019, as part of their monthly review of caastle ’s \nfinancial results, hunsicker’s finance team provided hunsicker with the company’s then -current \nunaudited income statement for the full fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 (“fiscal year \n2018”), generated from caastle’s internal records. these internal records reflected fiscal 2018 \nrevenues of $ 23.4 million , operating losses of $ 46.6 million , and net losses of $55.6 . hunsicker \nalso had access to this information on the company’s shared drive .  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 9 of 32  \n10 39. despite having access to company internal records, on  february 24, 2019, \nhunsicker emailed a prospective investor , who had been asking for financials  for months , a \ndocument that  she herself created. the document purported to be caastle’s f iscal 2018 income \nstatement  but instead was a fake. it reflected r evenue s of approximately $71.5 million and \noperating losses of approximately $ 24.1 million  for the fiscal year.  \n40. hunsicker subsequently provided the same fake fiscal 2018 income statement to at \nleast nine other investors . some of them invested for the first time or added to their investments \nafter receiving these false financials.  \n41. for example, between may 13 and june 16, 2019, hunsicker provided an investor \nwith multiple copies of the fake 2018 income statement, along with other falsified interim period \nfinancials and projections . on june 2 7, 2019, the investor signed a stock purchase agreement , and \non june 28, 2019, the investor wired $2 million to purchase caastle series a -11 preferred shares .  \n42. hunsicker knew or was reckless or negligent in not knowing the fiscal 2018 \nnumbers she provided to investors were materially false and did not reflect the information in caastle’s internal system of records.  \n43. hunsicker later received a copy of caastle’s final audit report for fiscal year 2018 , \nwhich auditor 1 completed and caastle’s finance team sent to her on february 7, 2020. the \naudited income s tatement  reported revenue of approximately $24.9 million and operating losses \nof approximately $53.6 million for fiscal y ear 201 8, which largely comported  with the unaudited \ninternal financial records that hunsicker  had received  from her finance team. the audited financial \nstatement s were accompanied by a clean audit opinion  with auditor 1’s  conclusion that \ncaastle’s fiscal year 2018 financial stateme nts presented fairly, in all material respects, caastle’s \nfinancial position in accordance with us gaap .  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 10 of 32  \n11 44. caastle’s  fiscal year 2018 audit report confirmed to hunsicker the falsity of the \nfiscal 2018 financial statements that she sent to investors. she did not send the fiscal year 2018 \naudit r eport to any investors , provide investors with corrected fiscal 2018 financial information , or \ntell investors that the fiscal 2018 financial information they received from her was inaccurate.  \nii. hunsicker falsified caastle’s fiscal 2019 financials  \n45. by no later than november 11, 2019, hunsicker’s finance team emailed her the \ncompany’s then- current unaudited income statement for the full fiscal year ended september 30, \n2019 (“fiscal year 2019”), generated from caastle’s internal records. these internal records \nreflected fiscal 2019 revenues of approximately $ 27.7 million , operating losses of approximately \n$54.4, and net losses of approximately $57 million. hunsicker also had access to this information \non the company’s shared drive.  \n46. despite her access to the company’s internal records, o n april 19, 2020, after an \nexisting investor asked for an update of the business, hunsicker created and emailed the investor \nwhat purported to be caastle’s  fiscal 2019 income statement . the income statement was a fake \nthat hunsicker herself created . the income statement reflected revenue of approximately  $89.8 \nmillion and operating losses of approximately $27.7 million for the fiscal year.  \n47. hunsicker subsequently provided her fake f iscal 2019 income statement to least six \nother caastle investors, knowing that they were materially wrong . some of them invested for the \nfirst time or added to their investments after receiving these financials .  \n48. hunsicker knew or was reckless or negligent in not knowing that that the f iscal \n2019 income statement did not reflect the information in caastle’s internal system of records .  \n49.  furthermore, on august 4, 2020, hunsicker received a copy of caastle ’s final \naudit report for fiscal year 2019 , which auditor 1 completed and signed on the same date . the case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 11 of 32  \n12 audited financial statements  reported revenue of approximately $26 million and operating losses \nof approximately $58.2 million for f iscal year 2019, which largely comported with the unaudited \ninternal financial records that hunsicker received from her finance team .  \n50. caastle’s fiscal y ear 2019 audit r eport confirmed to hunsicker the falsity of the \nfiscal 2019 financial statements that she sent to investors. she did not send the fiscal year 2019 \naudit report to any investor, or provide any investor with corrected fiscal 2018 financial \ninformation, or tell any investor that the information she had previously sent was materially inaccurate. she instead  continued to send her doctored fiscal 2019 income statement  to investors \n51. yet, on september 7, 2020, hunsicker provided an investor with a copy of the fake \n2019 income statement . the investor signed a stock purchase agreement and warrant purchase \nagreement on november 6, 2020. the next day, the investor wired $1.5 million to caastle to \npurchase caastle series a -11 preferred shares and common warrants.  \niii. hunsicker  falsified caastle’s fiscal 20 20 financials  \n52. by no later than november 24, 2020, hunsicker’s finance team provided her with \ncaastle’s then-current unaudited income statement for the full fiscal year ended september 30, \n2020 (“fiscal year 2020”), generated from caastle’s internal records. these internal records \nreflected fiscal 2020 revenue of approximately $ 24.7 million , operating losses of approximately \n$42.6 million, and net losses of approximately $44.9 million.  hunsicker also had access to this \ninformation on the company’s shared drive.  \n53. by march 6, 2021, hunsicker created and emailed to an existing investor a \ndocument that  purported to be caastle’s f iscal 2020 income statement . the income statement was \na fake that hunsicker herself cr eated. it reflected r evenue of approximately $93.3 million and \noperating losses of approximately $29.9 million  for the fiscal year.  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 12 of 32  \n13 54. hunsicker subsequently provided the same fake fiscal 2020 income statement to at \nleast ten other caastle investors. some of them invested for the first time or added to their \ninvestments after receiving these financials.  \n55. for example, on april 19, 2021, hunsicker emailed an existing investor a copy of \nthe fake 2020 income statement and a slide deck on the company, in response to his standing \nrequest that hunsicker keep him better informed and provide more regular financial updates. on \naugust 9, 2021, hunsicker emailed  the investor to inform him that the company was looking to \nraise $15 million to $20 million in additional capital, and wrote , “i would love for you to do some \nmore.” the investor  signed a stock purchase agreement  and wired $2 million to caastle on august \n20, 2021, for the purchase of caastle series a -12 preferred shares .  \n56. hunsicker  knew or was reckless or negligent in not knowing that the f iscal 2020 \nnumbers she sent to investors were materially false and did not reflect the information in caastle’s \ninternal system of records.  \n57. on may 24, 2021, hunsicker received a copy of caastle’s final audit report for \nfiscal year 2020 , which auditor 1 completed and signed  on the same date. the audited \nfinancial statements  reported revenue of approximately $25 million and operating losses of  \napproximately $45.3 million for f iscal year 2020, which largely comported with the internal reports \nreceived by hunsicker  received from her finance team . the audited financial statements were \naccompanied by a clean audit opinion with auditor 1’s conclusion that caastle’s fiscal year \n2020 financial statements presented  fairly,  in all material respects, caastle’s financial position in \naccordance with us gaap .  \n58. caastle’s fiscal year 20 20 audit report confirmed to hunsicker the falsity of the \nfiscal 2020 financial statements that she sent to investors. she did not send the fiscal year 2020 case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 13 of 32  \n14 audit report to any investor, or provide any investor with corrected fiscal 2020 financial \ninformation, or tell any investor that the information she had previously sent was materially inaccurate. indeed, she continued to send her doctored fiscal 2020 income statement to investors. \niv. hunsicker falsified caastle’s fiscal 2021 financials  and audit report  \n59. in late 2021, shortly after the close of fiscal year ended september 30, 2021 (“fiscal \nyear 2021”), one of caastle’s earliest investors told  hunsicker that they would not commit \nadditional investment funds to caastle, unless the company started to provide audited financials \nand to provide financial updates more regularly. other investors inquired about when caastle \nwould have audited financials  as well . hunsicker began to tell investors that caastle would have \naudited financials in 2022.  \n60. on february 22, 2022, auditor 1 completed its audit for caastle’s fiscal year \n2021 and hunsicker received a copy of the final audit report that day. auditor 1 completed \ncaastle’s audit on a more accelerated timeline that year than in prior years . the audited financial \nstatements reported fiscal year 2021 revenues of approximately $ 18.6 million  and operating \nlosses of approximately $ 32.3 million , which also largely comported with the unaudited internal \nfinancial records that hunsicker earlier received from h er finance team . the audited financial \nstatements were accompanied by a clean audit opinion with auditor 1’s conclusion that \ncaastle’s fiscal year 2021 financial statements presented fairly, in all material respects,  caastle’s \nfinancial position in accordance with us gaap.  \n61. the fiscal year 2021 audit report did not comport with the narrative that hunsicker \nhad been telling investors . therefore, c onsistent with her handling of prior fiscal year audit reports, \nhunsicker did not send the fiscal year 2021 audit report to any investor.  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 14 of 32  \n15 62. when investors inquire d about the status of the  fiscal year 2021  audit  in 2022, \nhunsicker provided different excuses for the delay, to buy herself time . on june 22, 2022, four \nmonths after auditor 1 issued its final audit report, hunsicker told  one investor that caastle \nwas still in the process of engaging an auditor . as 2022 progressed, hunsicker told investors that, \nas a private company, caas tle was not high on the auditor’s priority list, and the audit was slow -\ngoing and not complete . investors began to express concern about the audit delays.  \n63. hunsicker  ultimately decided, after having told investors that they can expect to see \naudited financials in 2022, to falsify caastle’s fiscal year 2021 audit report to provide a falsified \naudit to investors.   \n64. on or around november 30, 2022, hunsicker asked her finance team to locate a \nnon-final draft of the fiscal year 2021 audit report. the finance team did not ask why she wanted \na draft and, on november 30, 2022, emailed hunsicker a draft in word, with a note that it was the \nlatest draft they could locate . hunsicker took the draft, altered the numbers to support her narrative, \nchanged the audit opinion letter to remove the going concern opinion, and then added the words 12/2/2022 draft to the front page before  sending a pdf copy to the investor.  \n65. on december 2, 2022, hunsicker emailed an investor what purported to be a draft \nof the fiscal year 2021 audit report . she lied to the investor and told him that caastle’s accounting \nteam and the auditor were  still “turning versions” of the audit report but that the draft  was “further \nalong than [she] expected.” the draft contained an income statement that reflected revenue of \napproximately $120.5 million for the fiscal year – a material improvement over the prior fiscal \nyear – and operating losses of $33.7 million. the draft contained a balance sheet that reflected a \ncash balance of appro ximately $30.2 million  as of september 30, 2021. these numbers were \nmaterially  false  and not reflective of caastle’s internal records .  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 15 of 32  \n16 66. between december 2022 and march 2023, hunsicker provided the falsified draft \nfiscal year 2021 audit report to at least eight caastle investors, though she knew or was reckless \nor negligent in not knowing that the draft was a complete fake and that the financial information \nreflected in it was materially false .  \n67. from march 2023 through at least august 2023, hunsicker emailed at least 15 \ninvestors what purported to be a final fiscal year 2021 audit report . the “final” too was a fake \nthat reflected financial performance data similar to what had been reflected in the “draft” – \nmaterially overstated revenues of approximately $120.5 million, operating losses of  approximately \n$33.7 million, and a materially inflated cash balance of approximately $30.3 million  as of \nseptember 30, 2021. hunsicker changed the numbers, removed the auditor’s going concern \nopinion, and inserted auditor 1’s signature on to the doctored audit opinion letter. she dated \nthe opinion letter as of march 26, 2023, making it appear that auditor 1 had just completed the \naudit and finalized the report.  \n68. hunsicker knew or was reckless or negligent in not knowing that the fiscal year \n2021 audit report had been finalized and signed by auditor 1 ten months earlier and that “draft” and “final” versions she created and sent to investors w ere complete fakes and materially misstated \ncaastle’s true financial performance .  \nv. hunsicker falsified caastle’s fiscal 202 2 financials and audit report \n69. in march  2023, hunsicker announced to investors that caastle had generated a \nprofit and become cash flow positive for the first time in the quarter ending december 31, 2022 . \nshe supported her statement by providing investors with a false interim financial statement that \nwas not reflective of caastle’s internal financial records . caastle, in fact, had not become \nprofitable or cash flow positive  by december 2022.  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 16 of 32  \n17 70. hunsicker’s announcement  increased the appetite of caastle investors for audited \nfinancial statements , which hunsicker  appeased by creat ing a fake draft audit report with fake \nfinancial statements and fake notes  for fiscal  year ended september 30, 2022 (“fiscal year 2022”) , \nand then creat ing a fake final fiscal year 2022 audit report, to which she added auditor 1’s \nsignature .  \n71. on april 4, 2023, hunsicker emailed two existing and prospective investor s what \npurported to be a n april 3, 2023 draft of the fiscal year 202 2 audit report. she told the investor s \nthat caastle’s auditor was working through “presentation issues,” completing its audit of the \ncapitalization table, and finalizing the notes , suggesting that the financial statements in the draft \nreport were near -final or final. in reality , the draft was a fake created by hunsicker herself . the \nincome statement reflected revenue of approximately $ 238.5 million for the fiscal year, nearly \ndouble the amount that had been reflected in the fake fiscal year 2021 audit report . the balance \nsheet reflected a cash balance of approximately $ 42.5 million as of september 30, 2022. these \nnumbers did not comport with caastle’s internal records . the accompanying audit opinion letter \nand notes were devoid of any reference to caastle as a going concern .  \n72. one day after receiving hunsicker’s falsified “ draft ” of the fiscal year 2022 audit \nreport, a prospective investor  that had tracked caastle’s fake financial performance for years, \nsought authorization from its investment committee to commit  $7.5 million to purchase shares of \ncaastle’s series a -12 preferred stock and common warrants . the false data that hunsicker sent to \nthe investor – including fake fiscal 2021 and 2022 financial data – was important to the investor’s \ndecision- making process . the investor s igned a stock purchase agreement, a warrant purchase \nagreement, and other transactional documents, and wired $7.5 million to caastle’s bank account \non april 11, 2023.  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 17 of 32  \n18 73. from september 2023 through at least march 2024, hunsicker provided at least 10 \ninvestors with a document that purported to be a final fiscal year 2022 audit report . the document \nreflected false financial performance data similar to what had been reflected in the “draft” – \nmaterially overstated revenues of approximately $238.5 million  that were nearly double that of the \nprior year, operating losses of  approximately $17.1 million  that were nearly half of the prior fiscal \nyear, and a materially inflated cash balance of approximately $42.5 million as of september 30, \n2022. hunsicker cut and pasted into the document auditor 1’s signature  from a prior year’s \naudit report . like the fake draft, hunsicker’s fake final fiscal year 2022 audit report did not \nexpress warnings about caastle’s ability to continue as a going concern or its need to continue to \nraise capital to continue as a going concern .  \n74. hunsicker knew or was reckless or negligent in not knowing that the financial \ninformation reflected in the draft and final fiscal year 2022 audit reports that she provided to investors was materially false and did not comport with caastle’s internal records . while creating \nthe false reports, she was in possession of the internal financial statements and records that her \nfinance team sent earlier. the internal records reflected fiscal 2022 revenues of approximately $20 \nmillion , operating losses of approximately $34.1 million, and net losses of approximately $40 \nmillion, and a september 30, 2022 cash balance of approximately $621,000.  \n75. hunsicker also knew when she sent the fake draft and final fiscal year 2022 audit \nreports that: (a) caastle was experiencing a severe cash crunch and had instructed auditor 1 to \nstop working on caastle’s fiscal year 2022 audit in september 2023 and (b) auditor 1 had \nterminated its relationship with caastle  in early october 2023 in a written letter addressed to \nhunsicker .  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 18 of 32  \n19 76. caastle’s new auditor, auditor 2, completed the fiscal year 2022 audit on \ndecember 2, 2024. t he audited financial statements reported fiscal year 2022 revenues of \napproximately $19.7 million and operating losses of approximately $58.5 million, and a cash \nbalance of less than $750 ,000 as of september 30, 2022. these numbers were materially consistent \nwith the internal reports that hunsicker had received before sending her falsified fiscal 2022 \nfinancials to investors .  \n77. the audit report was accompanied by a clean audit opinion with auditor 2’s \nconclusion that caastle’s financial statements for fiscal year 202 2 presented fairly, in all material \nrespects, caastle’s financial position in accordance with us gaap. the audit report noted that \nthat “ [caast le] has suffered recurring losses from operations and requires additional debt or equity \nfinancing in the future to continue to fund its operations, which cannot be guaranteed. these factors \nraise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.”  \n78. hunsicker received a copy of the final audit report on december 2, 2024. she did \nnot send the r eport to any investors or provide investors with corrected fiscal year 2022 financial \ninformation.  \nvi. hunsicker  lied to cover her tracks  \nrelating to caastle’s fiscal 202 2 financials and audit report  \n79. hunsicker’s scheme nearly unraveled in october 2023 before she sent misleading \nfinancial statements to any i nvestor for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023. h er lies kept the \nscheme alive for over one more year .  \n80. in september 2023, an investor who received the fake fiscal year 2022 audit report \nfrom hunsicker noticed errors in the report that suggested it might not be fin al. the investor  \nemailed the fake report to auditor 1 and asked if auditor 1 had “conducted and completed” \nthe audit for fiscal year 2022 . auditor 1 told the investor tha t the report was  “not signed by case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 19 of 32  \n20 [auditor 1]” and was  “not a legitimate [auditor 1] opinion .” auditor 1 contacted \ncaastle’s head of finance and financial controller and hunsicker . hunsicker explained that this \nwas a one- off error. she claimed  that she had mistakenly sent the investor a marked up version of \nthe audit report that she intended to use in a lecture she was giving at princeton university on \nethics and entrepreneurship.  \n81. auditor 1  terminated its relationship with caastle on october 3, 2023. a lthough \nskeptical of hunsicker’s story , auditor 1 did not report her to the board of directors. caastle’s \nhead of finance and financial controller believed hunsicker’s excuse and also did not report her \nto the board of directors. caastle r edeemed the investor ’s shares at cost , and the investor did not \nreport hunsicker to the board of directors.  \n82. although hunsicke r took out personal loa ns and provide d the proceeds to caastle \nto enable it to redeem the investor’s shares, the loans came from caastle investors who were \nmisled about how she intended to use the loan proceeds . she ultimately repaid a majority of the \nloans by selling some of her personal shares of caastle preferred stock to an investor who had \nreceived false financials from her and w as unaware  of her fraud . the investor forgave his own $4 \nmillion loan to hunsicker and then paid an additional $3.5 million purportedly to purchase $7.5 \nmillion some of her personal shares at a discounted price. she attempted to repay the rest of her \npersonal loans by wiring funds from caastle’s bank account to the investor -lender , who has since \nreturned the funds to caastl e, and insisted that hunsicker pay the loan from her personal funds . \n83. with the board of directors unaware of hunsicker’s actions, or the real reason why \nauditor 1 had terminated its relationsh ip with caastle, hunsicker continue d her scheme .  \n84. exactly two business day s after auditor 1 terminated its relationship with \ncaastle, hunsicker sent  to a long- term caastle investor the fake  fiscal year 2022 final audit report case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 20 of 32  \n21 that auditor 1 had denounced. the investor purchased additional shares of caastle ’s a-12 \npreferred stock and common warrants days later  for its own account and an account held for the \nbenefit of a client  for over $2.5 million.   \n85. in march 2024, hunsicker sent the fake fiscal year 2022 audit report to another \nexisting caastle investor. in april 2024, the investor purchased more than $15 million additional \npreferred shares and common warrants for itself and a group of co-investors. \nvii. hunsicker falsified caastle’s fiscal 202 3 financials and audit report \n86. on september 24, 2024, as part of her continuing efforts to raise capital for caastle, \nhunsicker gave an investor access to a data room that contained a purported final audit report for \nfiscal years end ed september 30, 2022 and 2023 . the document was a fake  created by hunsicker . \nthe financial statements reflected fiscal 2023 revenues of approximately $439.9 million, total \nprofits of approximately $66.3 million, and a cash balance of approximately $112.8 million as of \nseptember 30, 2023, which did not comport with caastle’s internal records .   \n87. hunsicker knew or was reckless or negligent in not knowing that the fiscal 2023 \nfinancial information reflected in the audit report was materially false and did not comport with \ncaastle’s internal records.  \n88. caastle’s true fiscal year 2023 financial performance was dismal in comparison . \ncaastle’s internal records – which hunsicker had received from her finance team beforehand – \nreflected fiscal 202 3 revenues of approximately $ 15.6 million , operating losses of approximately \n$39.6 million, net losses of approximately $47.2  million, and a september 30, 2023 cash balance \nof approximately $880,000.  \n89. hunsicker also knew when she sent the fake fiscal year 2022-2023 audit report to \ninvestors that auditor 2 had not completed its fiscal 2023 audit yet . she drafted the report . she case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 21 of 32  \n22 cut and pasted auditor 1’s signature into the report from a prior audit. she scanned the \ndocument to herself.  \n90. the fake fiscal year 2022- 2023 audit report contained multiple facial errors. it was  \nmissing page 7, the stockholders’ equity report ; the notes were out -of-date; and t he audit opinion \nletter purported to be signed by auditor 1 on august 30, 2024.   \n91. within days of receiving the  fake fiscal year 2022- 2023 audit report from \nhunsicker, the investor described in paragraph 86 wired more than $25 million to caastle to \npurchase preferred shares and common warrants.  \n92. several  weeks later , hunsicker offered two different investors an opportunity to \nview the supposed final fiscal year  2022- 2023 audit report in her office . both investors accepted \nthe offer. they were shown the same fake audit report that hunsicker had loaded to the data room \non september 24.   \n93. auditor 2 completed caastle ’s fiscal year 202 3 audit on december 2, 2024, \nand issued it as a joint fiscal year 2022- 2023 audit report . the audit ed financial statements  \nreported fiscal 2023 revenues of approximately $ 15.7 million , operating losses of approximately \n$80.7 million, and a cash balance of less than $ 950,000 as of september 30, 2023. these numbers \nwere materially consistent with the internal reports that hunsicker had received from her finance \nteam before sending falsified fiscal 202 3 financials to investors , except for the audited  loss figure \nwhich was materially larger in comparison to the company’s internal records.  \n94. caastle was not profitable or cash -flow positive in fiscal year 2023. nor was it \nfinancing operations from its own cash flow. it had less than $1 million in cash and had suffered its largest losses to date. the real fiscal year 2022- 2023 audit report noted that that “ [caast le] \nhas suffered recurring losses from operations and requires additional debt or equity financing in case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 22 of 32  \n23 the future to continue to fund its operations, which cannot be guaranteed. these factors raise \nsubstantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.”  this is the same message that \npreviously appeared in every one of caastle’s “real” audit reports.  \nii. hunsicker procure d investments  using misleading sales tactics  \n95. by mid -2022, hunsicker  also hid from investors the extent to which caastle \ncontinued to rely on primary capital raises to fund its operations, and she provided capitalization \ntables that misled investors about caastle’s true capital structure. i nvestors who wanted to \nparticipate in secondary transactions ended up mostly participating in primary offerings, and \ninvestor interests were diluted  as a result .  \n96. prior to 2022, caastle raised  capital by selling original issue common shares and \nsuccessive rounds of preferred shares to investors . by late 2021, hunsicker began to tell investors \nthat caastle had largely completed its capital -raising rounds and was moving into a  final “pre- ipo \nround.” by july 2022, she told investors that caastle was close to “generating cash” and may not \nhave another capital -raising round. the false financial statements she provided to investors  in \nmarch 2023 fit her inaccurate narrativ e and falsely represented that  caastle had become profitable  \nand cash flow  positive by december 31, 2022, and was capable of generating sufficient revenue \nto independently fund its operations without the need for primary capital raises. caastle’s fake fiscal year 2022- 2023 audit report represented that caastle had not raised capital since the end of \nfiscal 2022.  \n97. in reality, caastle’s financial performance had worsened, and caastle relied on \nhunsicker’s continued ability to raise capital in order to survive . investors were unaware of this \nfact. several investors only invested because they believed  they were buying discounted shares in \nsecondary transactions. if they had known that caastle was continuing to raise capital – when its case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 23 of 32  \n24 balance sheet suggested that caastle has cash -rich – that information would have influenced their \ninvestment decision.  \n98. hunsicker structure d the supposed “secondary transactions” in a manner that \nallowed  her to conceal the true nature of the transaction s as a primary capital- raising event s. she \ntold prospective buyers that she was facilitating resales from early investors in caastle who were \nfacing liquidity issues or other requirements to sell their shares . then, a cting as intermediary, she \npurported to negotiate the transaction on behalf of both sides . the buyers had no contact with the \nsupposed sellers . the buyer s execute d transactional documents with caastle and wired funds to \ncaastle, and  caastle was supposed to use the proceeds to purchase shares from the seller.  \n99. the selling investors that hunsicker described, for the most part, did not exist. the \nmajority of the shares sold in purported secondary transactions were newly issued caastle shares. caastle used the funds for operations.   \n100. for example , on august 16, 2023, hunsicker solicited a prospective investor, \ntelling him she had “an employee who desperately needs some liquidity for an elder care situation.” hunsicker told the prospective investor that caastle would act as middleman by purchasing the shares from the employee and then sellin g shares to the investor. the selling employee that \nhunsicker described did not exist . the buyer purchased one million shares, believing the shares \nwould come from reissuances of previously issued shar es. caastle then issued a mix of new \npreferred and common shares to the buyer . the investor’s new shares increased the number of \noutstanding shares by one million, as reflected on caastle’s internal capitalization table. hunsicker \nmade the same offer concerning the same fictitious seller to multiple other investors, several of \nwhom purchase d shares in transactions that caas tle recorded as original share issuances.  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 24 of 32  \n25 101. occasionally, hunsicker herself was the seller in a secondary  transaction, though \nshe concealed her identity from the buyer , and caastle paid her full price to redeem her shares, \nnot the negotiated discounted price paid by the buyer.  \n102. for example, on july 25, 2022, hunsicker emailed an existing caastle investor with \nan opportunity to purchase shares from another caastle investor who she claimed had become a \ndirector of a large chinese public company and was being pushed by the “[c]hinese gov[ernmen]t … to sell his us tech stocks .” hunsicker told the investor that “because [the seller] is getting \npressure, he’s willing to do a substantial discount on his shares” at a price of $2.05 per share, which hunsicker described as a 67% discount to the price at which caastle sold shares in its last \nfundraising round. a day later, after the investor stated that he  needed time to determine how much \nhe could invest, hunsicker told the investor that the seller would be willing to sell 25% of his available shares to the investor for $1.50 per share . hunsicker then pressured the investor to act, \ntelling him that caastle would likely not do another funding round “since we are so close to \ngenerating cash.” hunsicker also sent the investor false income statements covering the period january through june 2022 and a false balance sheet as of june 30, 2022.  \n103. the investor agreed to purchase the shares at $1.50 per share and wired \napproximately $500,000 to caa stle the next day. caa stle recorded it as paid in capital. ca astle \nthen purchased preferred shares from hunsicker, not an executive of a chinese public company , \nand it paid her $6.20 per share , not $1.50.   \n104. hunsicker made the same offer to sell shares from the same fictitious investor to \nmultiple other investors . one of them purchased shares in a transaction that the company recorded \nas an original share issuance. the proceeds from that sale were not used to repurchase shares from \nhunsicker or any other real selling investor . caastle used the funds for operations.  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 25 of 32  \n26 105. to hide that these transactions were capital raises and not true secondary sales, \nhunsicker created and distributed false capitalization tables that omitted  the new share issuances \nand made it appear that outstanding share levels remained flat . for example, in response to a \njanuary 1, 2024 request from an existing investor for the capitalization table, hunsicker provided \na table that undercounted the outstanding shares at the time by more than 50 million shares (out of approximately 260 million) . the table  show ed the amount of shares that the investor expected.  \n106. hunsicker  further deceived the investor with her explanation that “[t]he changes \nfrom the last cap table are: your investments, retiring common shares, option grants during our annual cycle and options that have exercised to common.” the changes hunsicker mentioned amounted to negligible sums . hunsicker omitted mention of any new share issuances from capital \nraising in her statement.  \n107. caastle’s records show that, between december  2021 and july 2023, hunsicker \nwas the only shareholder on the  sell side of a secondary transaction, redeeming a total of \napproximately 675,000 shares , for which caastle paid her $6.20 per share, or more than $4 million.  \n108. caastle’s records also show that, i n the aggregate, between january 2022 and \ndecember 2024, caastle raised capital through the sale of 100 million newly issued caastle shares. these issuances caused caastle to exceed the number of authorized share totals  in 2023. \nthe board of directors later purportedly retroactively increased the number of authorized \noutstanding shares of common stock from 255 million to 350 million (a 37% increase) and the number of outstanding shares of preferred stock from 136,100,000 t o 152,850,000 (a 12% \nincrease).  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 26 of 32  \n27 iii. caastle’s board of directors learned of  \nhunsicker’s deception and the scheme ultimately unraveled  \n109. hunsicker’s scheme was ultimately  uncovered by an investor who had reviewed \ncaastle’s purported “final” fiscal year 2023 audit report in hunsicker’s office  on october 30, \n2024. after noticing that the report was missing a page and appeared to contain other errors that \nhunsicker was unable to explain , the investor asked hunsicker for a contact at auditor 1, the \naudit firm whose signature was on the report.  \n110. the investor contacted  auditor 1 and was told that auditor 1 did not conduct \nthe at -issue audit  and that caastle was not an active client .  \n111. the investor told hunsicker  of its call with auditor 1 and a sked for an  \nexplanation. hunsicker’s response came days later . she acknowledged, without specifying  the \ndetails, that there was “a problem, ” and she gave the investor two options: (i)  do nothing and give \nhunsicker time to “fix” the issue  because there was “value” in the company or (ii) redeem their \nshares. the investor chose neither option and instead reported hunsicker to caastle’s board of \ndirectors.  \n112. hunsicker resigned from caastle’s board of directors on december 14, 2024, after \nadmitting to her co -founder and a board member that she provided false financial information to \ninvestors.  \n113. hunsicker was allowed to remain as caastle’s ceo while the board conducted a \nfurther investigation, but during that time, restrictions were place d on her  authority . she was \nprohibited from , among other things,  raising capital for caastle or communicating with investors \non caastle’s behalf. any action she took required board approval.  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 27 of 32  \n28 114. while the board undertook its investigation, investors were not notified of \nhunsicker’s departure from the board or made aware of  the concerns that an investor had raised \nwith the board.  \n115. between december 14, 2024 and march 24, 2025, hunsicker circumvented the \nboard’s restrictions and took advantage of the fact that investors remained unaware of her \nwrongdoing, sold or purported to sell  her own shares of caastle stock to existing investors in \nsecondary transactions.   \n116. on or about december 30, 2024, hunsicker entered into an agreement with a large \nexisting investor in which she purported to sell some or all of her personal shares. the agreement was not documented in writing and hunsicker asked the investor to wire the funds to her personal bank account, not caastle . between january 9, 2025 and january 22, 2025, the investor wired \n$9,625,000 to hunsicker’s personal bank account. the investor was not aware that every financial statement that hunsicker had ever provided to t hem was materially false .   \n117. a few weeks later, in february 2025, hunsicker approached another investor an d \noffered to sell the  investor  9,300,000 shares of her preferred and common stock at a price of $2.15 \nper share. the investor was interested and, as part of its due diligence, asked hunsicker for a copy of the final fiscal 2023 audit report and cap table. on march 11, 2025, hunsicker provided the investor with the same fake fiscal 2023 audit that she had provided to investors in 2024, which led \nto her resignation from the board. the investor noticed a number of errors and inconsistencies in the audit report and did not go through with the transaction.   \n118. on or about march 18, 2025, hunsicker provided  another investor with a document \nthat purported to be caastle’s income statement for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2024 \n(“fiscal year 2024”), which reflected revenue of more than $ 848 million and losses of case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 28 of 32  \n29 approximately $192.2 million for the fiscal year. these numbers were materially false and had no \nbasis in reality. caastle’s internal records show fiscal 2024 revenues of approximately $11.3 \nmillion and losses of approximately $69 million.  \n119. hunsicker formally resigned as caastle’s ceo on march 24, 2025.  \n120. on march 25, 2025, the board of directors started to inform investors. in a letter \nto investors dated march 29, 2025, the board notified investors that hunsicker had stepped down as ceo and as a director, and acknowledged that the company’s “performance to date has not matched what hunsicker claimed.” the letter further stated that it learned that “[hunsicker] provided certain investors with misstated financial statements and falsified audit opinions, as we ll \nas capitalization information that understated the number of shares outstanding.” the letter advised investors not to rely on any financial or capitalization information received from hunsicker in the past and it attached caastle’s true fiscal 202 2 and 2023 audit report. \nfirst claim for relief  \nviolations of exchange act section 10(b) and rule 10b- 5

plaintiff, the united states securities and exchange commission (the “commission”), \nalleges the following against defendant robynne alexander .  \npreliminary statement  \n1. between at least 2018 and 2024, robynne alexander (“alexander”) defrauded  \ninvestors who purchased securities in various real estate investment projects. alexander raised a \ntotal of more than $4 million from at least 28 investors in connection with eight real estate \ninvestment projects.  alexander represented to her  investors that she would purchase, renovate, \nand sell properties for profit. however, she defrauded investors and misappropriated investor funds by using a substantial amount of investor money to pay fake investment returns to certain favored investors, to repay some investors and lenders in unrelated projects, and as her primary means of paying her personal expenses. she also falsely represented to investors, among other \nthings, that she would provide regular updates on the projects, that she maintained accurate books and records concerning the projects, and that any investment returns provided to investors case 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 1 of 23  \n2 \n \n would represent their share of  profits derived from the projects . none of these representations \nwere true: she never notified investors when she disposed of a property or when it was \nforeclosed upon; she rarely provided updates to investors and when she did, it was only after repeated requests; she never kept accurate books and records; and some purported investment returns paid to investors were not derived from profits on the projects but were made by  taking \nmoney from some investors to pay off others. \n2. as a result of alexander’s  misrepresentations and deceptive conduct in \nconnection with the offer and sale of the securities related to these real estate investment projects, investors have lost at least $3 million. \nviolations  \n3. as a result of the conduct alleged herein, alexander violated sections 17(a) (1)-(3) \nof the securities act of 1933 (the “securities act”) [15 u.s.c. §§ 77(e)(1)- (3)] and section 10(b) \nof the securities exchange

\nu.s.c. §§ 78u(d) and 78 aa]. \n6. this court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 u.s.c. § 1331.  \nalexander  has directly or indirectly made use of the means or instrumentalities of

2018 when she began accepting \ninvestments for her first real estate investment project in new england – raxx- lemay , llc, \nlater known as signature on elm , llc . between 2018 and 2021, alexander raised at least $2 \nmillion from 18 investors by issuing membership interests2 in a nevada limited liability \ncompany named raxx -lemay  llc (“ raxx -lemay”). many of the raxx -lemay  investors first  \nmet alexander as their real estate investment coach.  \n \n1 alexander was associated with a company  where she was paid to provide education on “foundational” real estate \ninvesting principles, personalized mentorship and advice, and connections in the real estate investing industry.  \n2 a membership interest represents an ownership interest in a limited liability company. ownership and governance \nof limited liability companies (or “  llcs ”) typically uses different terminology than corporations, such as  members \ninstead of shareholders, operating agreement instead of bylaws, and membership interests or units instead of shares \nof stock. an llc may assign different levels of voting and economic  rights to members by issuing different classes \nof membership interests.  https://www.sec.gov/resources -small -businesses/capital -raising -building- blocks/common-\nstartup -securities . case 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 5 of 23  \n6 \n \n 18. alexander provided to at least ten investors in the raxx- lemay project a six -page \ndocument titled “investment summary,” a 49- page document titled “private placement \nmemorandum”  (the “raxx -lemay ppm”) , and a 66-page document titled “operating \nagreement” (the “raxx -lemay operating agreement”) .  \n19. the raxx -lemay ppm  set forth the details of the investment. it stated that the \nproject required a “minimum dollar amount” of $2 million to be raised by the later of may 15, \n2018, or the date by which the property was “no longer under contract .”3 if the minimum dollar \namount was not raised i n that timeframe, raxx -lemay investors were to get their money back, \nwith interest. according to public records,  alexander, in large part with funds from a hard money \nlender4 that received a mortgage on the property, purchased the property on july 27, 2018. \ntherefore, the property was “no longer under contract” as of july 27, 2018. also as of july 27, \n2018, alexander had only raised a total of $7 00,000 for the raxx- lemay project. alexander , \nhowever, did not return any funds  to raxx- lemay investors  as required under  the raxx -lemay \nppm.  \n20. because alexander did not raise the minimum dollar amount by july 27, 2018, \nthe date the property was “ no longer under contract,” she was  not entitled to use investor funds \nfor any purpose, including collecting any management fees .  \n21. despite having been obligated to return the raxx -lemay investors’ funds  as of \njuly 27, 2018, alexander went on to use investor money for other purposes that were not \n \n3 the ppm includes this statement in the “summary of offering” section on page one and in the “executive \nsummary on page six. however, section 2.5 of the ppm includes a statement that says, “[i]f the minimum dollar \namount has not been raised by may 15, 2018 (or at such time as the property is no longer under contract, whichever \ncomes first), the manager will not break impounds and all funds, including any interest earned thereon, will be returned to investors without deduction.”  alexander did not raise the minimum dollar amount by the prescribed \ndeadline in either statement.  \n4 a “hard money lender” refers to an individual or company (rather than a bank or conventional lender) that makes \nloans secured by real property, generally short -term bridge loans, primarily in real estate transactions. hard money \nloans generally have higher interest rates than more traditional financing options.  case 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 6 of 23  \n7 \n \n permissible under the raxx- lemay ppm. section 2.7.1 of the raxx- lemay ppm states that the \nproject “involves  the acquisition of two specific commercial buildings sharing a common party \nwall located at 121 1 & 1217 elm street, manchester , new hampshire 03101 (the property), for \nthe purchase price of one million eight hundred thousand dollars ($1,800,000).”  the \nexecutive summary for the raxx- lemay ppm states that the “funds raised from this offering \nwill be used to purchase, improve, operate, and ultimately dis pose of the property, to reimburse \nthe manager for its acquisition costs, and to compensate the manager in the form of fees for \nmaking this investment opportunity available to investors.”  investor funds were thus only to be \nused to acquire and renovate the two properties identified in the raxx- lemay ppm.   \n22. the raxx -lemay ppm includes further details about how investor funds would \nbe used.  section 3 includes the following chart summarizing the sources and  uses of  investor \nproceeds :  case 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 7 of 23  \n8 \n \n  \n23. section 5 also includes the below chart describ ing the manager’s fees or other \ncompensation:  \ncase 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 8 of 23  \n9 \n \n  \n24. as described above, alexander was not entitled to use any investor funds, having \nfailed to meet the minimum dollar amount. she nevertheless used raxx- lemay investor funds \nfor purposes other than those set forth in the raxx -lemay ppm. between july 2018 and \nnovember 2018, alexander used raxx -lemay  investor funds as collateral to draw  $1.3 million \nfrom a line of credit  held in the name of another entity she owned and controlled. in september \nand october 2018, alexander  then used a portion of the $1.3 million to pay back at least four  \ninvestors in projects other than raxx -lemay, in an amount totaling approximately $282,000. \nalexander later used raxx -lemay investor  funds to repay the line  of credit .   \ncase 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 9 of 23  \n10 \n \n 25. in july 2021, alexander also used raxx -lemay  investor funds to make payments \nto two raxx- lemay investors totaling approximately $435,000. alexander also used  raxx -\nlemay  investor funds to pay lenders and costs related to other real estate investment projects and  \nto make loans to herself or other entities she co ntrolled  totaling at least $ 110,000.  \n26. all told, alexander misused at least  $820,000 of raxx- lemay investor money for \npurposes that had nothing to do with acquiring and renovating the two properties. \nb. alexander failed to obtain investor approval for the transfer of the \nproperty  \n \n27. in july 2021, alexander received a $600,000 investment in the raxx- lemay \nproject from a company  controlled by two raxx-lemay investors (investors c and d) in \nexchange for 25% of the ownership of raxx- lemay. the company was also to perform the \ngeneral contracting services for the raxx -lemay project. between july 2021 and february 2022, \ninvestors c and d learned that alexander had not filed raxx-lemay’s tax returns, that alexander \nfailed to keep ordinary business records, that alexander was struggling to keep up with payments to raxx- lemay’s hard  money lender, and that alexander would not be able to finance the \nrenovation of the raxx-lemay buildings.  \n28. as a result of these discoveries, investors c and d sought to take control of the \nraxx -lemay project. to accomplish that, alexander agreed to give investors c and d an 81% \ninterest  in signature on elm, llc (“signature on elm”) - an entity alexander created in july \n2021 - while retaining a  19% interest  for herself. alexander then transferred the real estate raxx -\nlemay owned to signature on elm in february 2022. at the time of the transfer, investors c and d believed that alexander was the sole owner of raxx -lemay  because alexander never \nmentioned the other investors in raxx- lemay . signature on elm later  obtained traditional case 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 10 of 23  \n11 \n \n commercial bank financing to pay off raxx- lemay’s  hard  money lender and associated fees, \ntotaling roughly $2.8 million, as compensation for taking over the ownership of the property .  \n29. alexander did not have the authority to transfer the property from raxx- lemay to \nsignature on elm without the knowledge and consent of raxx- lemay investors. as a general \nmatter, section 6.1 of the raxx- lemay operating agreement  gave alexander the authority to \n“manage all business and affairs of the company .”  but that authority was not unlimited, \nparticularly with respect to the sale of the raxx -lemay property. specifically, section 14.1 of the \nraxx -lemay operating agreement states that the “the company shall be dissolved upon… the \nsale of the property (which will require the affirmative vote of a majority of interests).” in other \nwords, a majority of the raxx- lemay investors would have had to approve the sale to signature \non elm. not only did alexander violate this provision in the raxx -lemay o perating agreement, \nshe kept the other raxx -lemay investors in the dark despite the fact that section 10.8 of the \nraxx -lemay ppm provides that  alexander  “intends to conduct periodic teleconferences and/or \nemail updates with the members, as the manager deems necessary to keep them apprised about affairs involving the company.”   \n30. despite the  clear terms of  the raxx -lemay operating agreement  and raxx -\nlemay ppm , alexander  transferred the  raxx -lemay  real estate to signature on elm  without \nproviding notice or obtaining the approval of a majority of the raxx- lemay  investors . as a \nresult of the transfer, raxx -lemay , which did not have any interest in signature on elm, had no \nreal estate holdings, a fact that was concealed from the other raxx -lemay investors whose \ninvestments then became worthless.  \n \n case 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 11 of 23  \n12 \n \n c. alexander failed to provide required annual information packages to \ninvestors \n \n31. the raxx -lemay ppm states that  alexander, as the manager, will prepare an \nannual information package that …will include such things as an annual operations update, \nfinancial statements, k -1 forms5, and a copy of the company tax return, as applicable.” at least \nfive raxx -lemay investors did not receive financial statements, k -1s, or regular updates, \nincluding after repeated written and oral requests to alexander regarding raxx- lemay .  \nelm and baker  \n32. alexander received the first investment to purchase and renovate a property \nlocated at 4 elm st. i n manchester, new hampshire from investor e on november 26, 2019, \ntotaling $ 120,000. she deposited the money into a bank account for four on elm, llc (“four on \nelm”) .  \n33. the certificate of formation for four on elm lists investor e as a member of the \nentity and the wire memo for investor e’s $120,000 investment states “real estate llc contribution.”  \n34. on or about december 4, 2019, four on elm, through alexander, issued an \ninvestment for $ 140,000 to  investor f . the  investment security was documented in the form of a  \npromissory note\n6 that required a “lump sum repayment of $140,000.00 plus 12% per annum due \non december 1, 2021 or sooner.” the note also states  that “[a]ll proceeds of the loans shall be \n \n5 a k-1 form is an irs form used by partnerships, s corporations, and estates and trusts  to declare the income, \ndeductions, and credits that partners, shareholders, and beneficiaries have received in the tax year.   \n6 the promissory note is a security. the proceeds of the note were intended to be used for developing 4 elm st. , the \ninvestor was motivated to make the investment for the expected profit from the high interest rate, the investor \nthought of the promissory note as a security, and there is no alternate regulatory scheme with oversight of the promissory note.  case 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 12 of 23  \n13 \n \n used solely for the purposes more particularly provided for and limited by the the [sic] \nacquisition and construction build out of 4 elm street, manchester, nh.”  \n35. on december 5, 2019, four on elm purchased the 4 elm st. property.  \n36. approximately a year after receiving investments from investors e and f in four \non elm, alexander formed a second entity , elm and baker, llc (“elm and baker”) , to accept \nadditional investments related to the 4 elm st. property . alexander issued membership interests \nin elm and baker to two investors, investor g and investor h. each of those investors received \nan operating agreement governing the ir investments in elm and baker.  the operating agreements \nthat investor g and investor h received contain differing terms despite both being in effect at the \nsame time.  \n37. investor g executed  a version of the elm and baker operating agreement \n(“investor g operating agreement”) on may 25, 2021 and invested $750,000 in elm and baker \non may 27, 2021. the investor g o perating agreement states  that elm and baker will own the 4 \nelm st. property by june 30, 2021 and that if it doesn’t , elm and baker will return investor g’s \nmoney along with 8% interest.  \n38. although alexander controlled the 4 elm st. property through four on elm, she \ndid not transfer the property to elm and baker until january 27, 2022, more than six months after \nshe was  required  to under the investor g operating agreement. alexander did not return investor \ng’s money or the required interest.   \n39. the investor g operating agreement includes a “principal purpose” section that  \nstates  that elm and baker’s “ sole purpose is to develop the property into an adaptive reuse \nconversion to apartments to be sold on the market ” and that investor g would have received her \ninvestment principal and 25% of the net sale profits  after the sale of the property.  case 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 13 of 23  \n14 \n \n 40. investor g understood, based on the investor g operating agreement and \nconversations with alexander , that the  investment would be used to renovate the 4 elm st. \nproperty. alexander  instead  used approximately $327,000 of investor g’s investment to repay \ninvestors e and f $260,000, plus $67,000 in purported return on investment  in june 2021. \nalexander also used approximately $210,000 of investor g’s  investment to pay investors \nunrelated to the 4 elm st. property in may and june of 2021. alexander thus misappropriated \ninvestor g’s money for purposes unrelated to acquiring and renovating the 4 elm st. property .  \n41. investor h  executed the first version of the elm and baker operating agreement \n(the “investor h operating agreement”) on march 11, 2021. that same day, investor h wired the \nfirst of four investment installments  to alexander in the amount of $25,000. investor h wired t he \nfinal of the four installments  to alexander on october 22, 2021. the total amount of the four \ninstallments wired to alexander was $150,000.  \n42. the investor h operating agreement includes a different “principal purpose” \nsection from the investor g operating agreement. the investor h operating agreement simply states that “[elm  and baker’s] principal purpose shall be to purchase, lease and sell real estate. \nthe llc may also pursue any other purpose permitted by law and approved by the managers.”  \nhowever, based on statements made by  alexander, investor h understood that his investment \nwould be used to renovate the 4 elm st. property.  \n43. alexander used at least $50,000 of investor h’s investment  for project expenses \nunrelated to elm and  baker, numerous “loans” to herself or other business entities, and personal \nexpenses such as grocery bills . each of these uses was an improper use of investor h’s money. \n44. despite her statements to investors, the property was never  developed, the project \nfailed , and the property went into foreclosure in may 2023. case 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 14 of 23  \n15 \n \n hb9g  \n45. alexander formed hb9g, llc (“hb9g”) on january 17, 2020, purportedly to \nobtain investments to purchase, renovate, “stabilize,” and sell a multifamily property located at 9 \ng st. in hampton, new hampshire. between january 16, 2020 and january 28, 2020, alexander \nreceived a total of $273,000 from three investors in exchange for membership interests in hb9g.  \n46. all three investors received and executed the same version of the hb9g operating \nagreement. the hb9g operating agreement includes a “principal purpose” section that states \nthat the “llc’s principal purpose shall be to purchase, lease and sell real estate.” based on \nstatements made to them by  alexander, all three investors understood that alexander would only \nuse the investment funds to purchase and improve the 9 g st. property. alexander also showed a \nprivate placement memorandum to at least one investor. t he private placement memorandum \nstated that alexander would renovate and sell the 9  g st. property to generate investment returns.  \n47. despite these statements to investors, alexander improperly used approximately \n$50,000 of the $273,000 she raised for expenses related to other real estate investments and  \npersonal expenses  in february 2020.  \n48. in response to frequent requests for updates from investors, alexander sent an \nemail update to investors on april 3, 2023, more than three years after the initial investments. \nalexander told the investors that the property was in a “deteriorated state” and that it needed \n“approximately $100k in renovations to bring it where it needs to be for high- season rentals.” \neven though alexander told investors she would renovate and sell the property , the property was \nnot renovated and went into foreclosure  in november 2023. investors were not notified of the \nforeclosure which rendered their investments worthless . case 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 15 of 23  \n16 \n \n 49. from the time alexander  received the investments in 2020 until she started \nproviding updates in 2023, i nvestors continued to request updates and began threatening legal \naction. in response, alexander made promises of repayment  to the investors , including with \nreturns on the initial investment.  however, because she no longer owned the property, she  would \nhave to  use funds intended for a different project called legacy at laconia  to make any \nrepayments to the hb9g investors. in an email to the  hb9g investors  on november 24, 2023, \njust 13 days after the property was foreclosed upon, alexander said she was “working with \nseveral lenders that are helping us with working capital to exit you as an investor. [lender a]  is \nproviding us a $40m loan which will be used for the purchase of a large property (21.5m) up in \nthe lakes area and the remaining funding is to be used for operating capital.”   that representation \nwas false. alexander was not working with lenders relating to investors in hb9g. she was \nactually working with lenders to purchase a large property for a different project  that none of the \nhb9g investors were invested in.  \n50. in another email on march 2, 2024. alexander told investors that she was “fully \napproved for a large institutional line of credit which was originally only for the purchase of the \nstate property (laconia). it has since been expanded to include any real estate transaction meaning we can use the funds for any of my r eal estate projects – past or present.”  that \nrepresentation was false. alexander had not been fully approved for a large institutional line of \ncredit , nor was she ever approved for such.  \n51. alexander never received a line of credit for the legacy at laconia project  \ndescribed below  and no hb9g investors received any repayment much less any returns  on their \ninvestments.   \n case 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 16 of 23  \n17 \n \n legacy at laconia \n52. alexander, on behalf of legacy at laconia, llc (“legacy at laconia”), signed a \npurchase agreement dated november 30, 2022 to purchase from the state of new hampshire a \nproperty known as the “state of new hampshire lakes region facility” – a 217- acre propert y in \nlaconia, new hampshire (the “laconia property”) . the legacy at laconia project is described \non “legacyatlaconia.com,” as a project to  “create a first in the world, innovative, world class \nresort implementing universal design with barrier free accessib ility within an all- in-one \nsustainable village.”  \n53. alexander offered membership interests through a different entity called legacy \nat laconia fund llc  through the website , which would accept and pool investments to be used \nin the legacy at laconia project. the “investment details” tab of legacyatlaconia.com described \na “secure & simple investment process” seeking $40 million for a  round a offering. in \nexchange for investments, investor s would receive units in legacy at laconia fund llc. \nalexander did not receive any investments in legacy at laconia fund llc . \n54. however, alexander received one investment of $250,000 in legacy at laconia  – \nthe entity that entered into the purchase agreement for the laconia property -  from investor b on \noctober 11, 2023. legacy at laconia documented the investment in the form of a  promissory \nnote that would be payable, with all “simple, non- compounded accrued interest [at a] rate of \n15.00%” by february 15, 2024 – an approximate period of 4 months. the note was secured by a \n“collateral assignment of life insurance of [alexander’s] ” life insurance policy. investor b’s \nfunds were wired to a legacy at laconia bank account in alexander’s control. like the \npromissory note alexander issued for four on elm, this note was a security. case 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 17 of 23  \n18 \n \n 55. despite investor b’s funds being given to legacy at laconia, alexander \nmisappropriated at least $75,000 for payments related to other real estate investment projects, \npersonal living expenses, and nearly $5,000 of personal travel expenses in  paris, barcelona, \nvalencia, nassau, florida, and new orleans  in october and november 2023.  \n56. to date, investor b has not received any repayment. because alexander could not \nsecure financing to close the purchase of the laconia property, the s tate of new hampshire \nterminated the sale agreement on april 21, 2024. the property is now under agreement with another purchaser unrelated to alexander.  \nother i nstances of alexander misappropriating investor f unds  \n57. in addition to the four projects described above, between august 2019 and \nfebruary 2024 alexander obtained a total of at least $360,000 from four investors in four other purported real estate projects . \na. 9 cross st. somerville, massachusetts \n58. alexander received one investment for a total of $100,000 from investor b, who \nalso invested in legacy at laconia. she deposited those funds into a bank account in the name of any property rehab llc (“any property rehab”), an entity alexander used to fund miscellaneous real estate investment projects. investor b’s funds were wired into any property rehab’s account on february 2, 2024 with a wire memo stating “for 9 cross st., somerville ma.” at the time investor b’s funds were deposited into any property rebab’s \naccount, the account balance was $204.45.  \n59. on february 5, 2024, alexander wired $81,579.00 to investor a, a raxx- lemay \ninvestor, from the same any property rehab bank account that held investor b’s investment case 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 18 of 23  \n19 \n \n funds . alexander thus improperly used investor b’s investment funds to repay investor a the \nprincipal investment amount and purported return -on-investment for the raxx- lemay project .  \n60. the property at 9 cross st. is being foreclosed upon and investor b has not been \nrepaid.  \nb. 23 country club rd. manchester, new hampshire \n61. on november 12, 2019, alexander received one investment for a total of $36,000 \nfor a project on 23 country club rd. in manchester, new hampshire. alexander documented the \ninvestment in the form of a promissory note that required a “lump sum payment in the amount of $36,000…plus $4,320 which represents 12% per annum due on december 1, 2020 or sooner – for a total amount due of $40,320.” the investor understood that when the property was sold, the repayment, including interest, would come out of the proceeds of the sale. like the promissory \nnote alexander issued for four on elm, this note was a security.  \n62. alexander sold the 23 country club rd. property in may 2020 for $120,000. \ndespite having sold the property and telling the investor that repayment would come from the proceeds of the sale, alexander  used $77,000 of the money from the title company for the sale of \nthe 23 country club rd. property to repay an investor in a different property – 37 c st. manchester, nh – on june 3, 2020.  \n63. to date, alexander has only paid $4,500 of the total amount due under the \ninvestment to the investor in the 23 country club rd. property.  \nhaverhill, massachusetts project  \n64. on june 8, 2022, alexander received one investment totaling $75,000 to purchase \na property in haverhill, massachusetts. alexander was not able to secure a property transaction case 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 19 of 23  \n20 \n \n in haverhill, massachusetts and repaid the investor a total of $100,000 using funds related to an \nunrelated portfolio of properties in rhode island.   \nfirst claim for relief  \nviolations of section 17(a) of the securities act of 1933  \n65. the commission repeats and incorporates by reference the allegations in \nparagraphs 1 through 64 above. \n66. by engaging in the conduct described above, alexander, in connection with the \noffer or sale of securities, by the use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce or of the mails, directly or indirectly, acting intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or negligently (i) employed devices, schemes, or artifices to defraud,

(“ enerkon ”). as the sole officer and controlling \nshareholder of enerkon, ballout schemed to inflate enerkon’s stoc k price primarily through false \nand misleading statements and omissi ons in its public statements and disclosures to investors. with \nthe help of ballout, fielding and zayed then pr ofited from the scheme through the conversion of \na bogus promissory note into enerkon stock, which they sold to a third party at inflated prices.     \n2. ballout acquired a controlling interest in  enerkon in or around february 2018, and \nthereafter became enerkon’s sole officer. enerkon was a penny-stock company that had no \nemployees (aside from ballout) or legitimate business operations. ba llout made a series of false case 9:24-cv-81170-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 09/23/2024   page 1 of 22 2 \n and misleading statements and o missions to pump enerkon’s stock price, including misstatements \nand omissions about enerkon’s supposed busine ss opportunities, assets, and liabilities.    \n3. for example, in 2021, ballout authored a nd issued three pre ss releases falsely \nclaiming that enerkon: (1) acquired a company with distribution right s to a covid-19 instant test, \n(2) received a $28 million order for the tests, and (3) purchased 122 acres in pennsylvania to build \na power plant.  zayed, who had a longstanding relations hip with ballout, fabricated a bogus \npurchase order purporting to evidence the $28 million order. on june 22, 2021, based on these \npress releases and questions concerning the accuracy of other public statements or disclosures that \nenerkon made to investors, the sec temporaril y suspended trading in enerkon’s securities. \n4. prior to the trading suspen sion, fielding and zayed coordinated with ballout to \ncapitalize on the inflated price of enerkon’s stock. they did so through a convertib le promissory \nnote that enerkon issued to fielding as purpor ted consideration for a $180,000 loan. in reality, \nfielding never made a $180,000 loan to enerkon, a nd the note was backdated to november 2017 \nand signed by ballout, even though he had no affi liation with enerkon in november 2017. in \nmarch 2021, enerkon’s transfer agent received an em ail from fielding’s email account, instructing \nthe transfer agent to convert th e bogus promissory note into en erkon stock. the email attached a \nfabricated fielding bank account statement and other false record s, purporting to evidence his \nalleged $180,000 loan. relying on these false document s, the transfer agent issued enerkon stock \nto fielding as instructed. in tr ansactions coordinated and negotia ted on his behalf by zayed and \nballout, fielding then sold a portion of his ener kon shares to a third- party investor for $407,000. \nfielding later paid $96,000 of the trad ing profits to zayed for his role in the fraudulent scheme.      \n5. by engaging in the acts and conduct a lleged herein, defendants violated the

of ca nton, michigan. between february 2018 and \noctober 6, 2022, he was the presid ent, chief executive officer (“ ceo ”), and chief financial \nofficer (“ cfo ”) of enerkon, as well as a member  of its board of directors.  \n10. defendant zayed is a citizen and resident  of egypt. in 1997, za yed was indicted by \na federal grand jury for wire fraud, scheme to defraud, and mone y laundering, and a warrant was \nissued for his arrest. see united states v. zayed , no. 1:97-cr-0039 (e.d. tenn.). in 1998, the sec \nsued zayed for securities fraud in connection with  the promotion and sale of the stock of genesis \ninternational financial services, inc., alleging that he used fra udulent financial statements and \npress releases to deceive  prospective investors. see sec v. zayed , no. 1:98-cv-327 (e.d. tenn.); \nsec lit. release no. 15907 (sept. 24, 1998). the se c was not able to serve zayed with that \nlawsuit and subsequently dismissed its cl aims against zayed without prejudice.  \n11. defendant fielding is a resident of delr ay beach, florida. he was formerly the \nregistered agent of enerkon, includi ng during at least part of the rele vant events discussed herein.  \niv. related entity  \n12. enerkon was a nevada corporation with it s principal place of  business in new \nyork, new york. its comm on stock was quoted and tr aded on over-the-counter (“ otc ”) markets \nunder the symbol “enks.” it published otc disclo sure statements and otc financial reports \npursuant to the pink basic disclosure guidelines  through a publicly availa ble website maintained \nby otc markets group, inc. on june 22, 2021, the sec suspended tr ading in enerkon’s securities \npursuant to section 12(k) of the securities act.  on or about october 6, 2022, enerkon was sold to \nnew investors who subsequently rename d it and put in new management.  case 9:24-cv-81170-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 09/23/2024   page 4 of 22 5 \n v. facts \na. defendants and enerkon  \n13. ballout became enerkon’s pr esident, ceo, and cfo in or around february 8, 2018, \nafter acquiring a controlling interest  in the company from its prior owner, and he remained its sole \nofficer until approximately october 6, 2022. between february 2018 and october 2022, ballout drafted enerkon’s press releases and had sole authority to appr ove them. he also drafted and \napproved all of enerkon’s otc disclosures, otc financial reports, and other public filings.  \n14. fielding and zayed have a longstanding business rela tionship through a company \nthat they jointly own that focuses on defense/s ecurity in the middle east. through that work and \nbefore ballout acquired a controlling interest in enerkon, fielding and zayed met and developed \na relationship with ballout, who was also working in the defense/security industry at the time.  \n15. subsequently, fielding and zayed became involved in enerkon, with zayed acting \nin an unofficial role and fielding serving as its registered agent. fielding also purported to be \nenerkon’s lender and shareholder th rough a bogus promissory note that he converted to shares of \nenerkon, as further discussed below.  \n16. informally, fielding let ball out and zayed use his credit cards to pay miscellaneous \nexpenses for enerkon, including en erkon expenses relating to otc administrative fees, publishing \npress releases, domain hosting fees , and other similar charges. thes e charges were typically in the \nrange of $2,000–$3,000 per month, and were commingled with charges that fielding, ballout, or zayed made on the same credit cards for expenses  unrelated to enerkon. fiel ding testified that he \nwas reimbursed for some of these monthly charge s relating to enerkon, but not all. it does not \nappear that enerkon contemporaneously or formally : (i) accounted in its books and records for the \nexpenses that were paid for with fielding’s credit cards; or (ii) disclosed these expenses in its otc \ndisclosures, otc financial statemen ts, or other public disclosures.  case 9:24-cv-81170-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 09/23/2024   page 5 of 22 6 \n b. ballout made a series of false and misleadi ng statements and omissions to investors \nin furtherance of his scheme to inflate enerkon’s stock price.  \n17. shortly after acquiring a c ontrolling interest  in enerkon in february 2018 and \ncontinuing until the sec suspended trading in enerkon’s securities on june 22, 2021, ballout knowingly or severely recklessly engaged in a sc heme to inflate the price of enerkon’s publicly \ntraded stock. he sought to a ccomplish this scheme primarily  through false and misleading \nstatements and omissions in ener kon’s press releases and public fi lings—all of which he authored \nand approved as the sole office r of enerkon. these false and misl eading statements and omissions \ncreated false and misleading impressions about en erkon’s supposed busine ss opportunities, assets, \nand liabilities.  \ni. ballout’s scheme to pump enerkon’s stock price  \n \n18. as the controlling shareholder in enerkon, ballout had a strong financial \nmotivation to pump enerkon’s stoc k price. during the course of his scheme, ballout owned 33 \nmillion shares of enerkon stock, mo re than 50% of its outstanding stock. by increasing the value \nof enerkon stock, he stood to make  a significant profit th rough the eventual sale of his shares.  \n19. however, enerkon was not engaged in a ny known profit-generating business. at \nall relevant times, enerkon’s bank account ha d less than $100. and following ballout’s acquisition \nof enerkon, he relied on fielding’s  personal credit card to help f und enerkon’s operating expenses.  \n20. rather than work to improve enerkon’s business or to enha nce its underlying \nfinancial value, ballout develope d and implemented a scheme to artificially inflate the price of \nenerkon’s stock. to that end, by at least early 2 021, ballout touted plans to increase enerkon’s \nstock price above $4.00 per share to  qualify for listing on the nasd aq stock exchange. in a march \n2021 press release, for example, ballout cited the company’s continued plans to qualify for trading \non nasdaq. in another press release dated may 20, 2021, ballout again cited enerkon’s “up list case 9:24-cv-81170-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 09/23/2024   page 6 of 22 7 \n plans to the nasdaq market which maintains a minimum share entry price of $4.00 to qualify \nfor listing on the national exchange.”  \n21. ballout’s scheme, however, was foiled when the sec suspended trading in \nenerkon’s securities on june 22, 202 1. according to the sec’s pres s release dated june 22, 2021, \nthe temporary suspension was “due to, among other things, lack of adequate and accurate information in enerkon’s quarterly  and annual financials ” and questions regard ing “the accuracy \nand adequacy of publicly disseminated informati on in press releases,” including the three press \nreleases discussed further below. before the sec suspended trading, ballout knowingly or \nseverely recklessly made materially false statem ents and omissions and engaged in deceptive acts \nin furtherance of his scheme, including but not limited to the examples discussed below.  \nii. ballout made false and misleading statem ents and omissions in enerkon’s press \nreleases concerning supposed business opportunities arising from a covid-19 test device. \n \n22. on march 9, 2021, enerkon issued a press release, which ballout authored and \napproved. the press release touted enerkon’s purporte d partial acquisition of  a u.k. corporation \nbased in london, england (the “ agent ”). it also discussed a covi d-19 test device manufactured \nby a canadian company (the “ manufacturer ”), and for which another canadian company held \nexclusive distribu tion rights (the “ distributor ”). in relevant part, the press release stated:    \nwe are pleased to announce that we have  completed the initial acquisition of \n[agent] whereby a 40% stake was acquired and an additional 60% is expected to \nbe acquired additionally in the coming week . . . [agent ] owns distribution rights \nto a new covid-19 test device, produced by [manufacturer] and [distributor], \nwhich is a rapid (15 seconds) test device . . .     23. in reality, the agent did not own distribut ion rights to the covid-19 test device \nreferenced in the march 9, 2021 pre ss release. in late 2020, agent entered a sales-representative \nagreement with the distributor, the master distributor of products  manufactured by the case 9:24-cv-81170-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 09/23/2024   page 7 of 22 8 \n manufacturer. but that agreement did not give ag ent any distribution righ ts to those products. a \nsubsequent memorandum of u nderstanding dated january 24, 2021, between distributor and \nagent also made clear that agent did not own distribution rights.  \n24. distributor’s executives also expressly in formed ballout and za yed that agent did \nnot own any distribution rights to the covid-19 test. upon lear ning of the march 9, 2021 press \nrelease, a distributor executive sent an ema il on or around march 17, 2021 to ballout, copying \nzayed, expressly informing him:  \nunfortunately, the information you are sendi ng out in the public to raise funds and \nawareness is completely fals e. we have entertained di scussions with [agent] to \neventually become a sub-distributor of [dis tributor] for the sale  and distribution of \nvarious products and services for which we hold the rights th rough proper and legal \ncontracts with the patent hol der [manufacturer]. to date no firm contract has been \nfinalized or even less signed. your webs ite is advertising false and misleading \ninformation. [agent] does not own the di stribution rights to the [covid-19] insta-\ntest and does not have any formal rights wh atsoever at this time. because of this i \ninsist you remove all menti on of [distributor] and refe rence covid [sic] testing \nreferring to our companies.   25. ballout knew, or was severe ly reckless in not knowing, that the statement in the \nmarch 9, 2021 press release that  “[agent] owns distribution rights to a new covid-19 test \ndevice, produced by [a canadian manufacturer] and [dis tributor]” was false or misleading at the \ntime it was made. also, based on the email th e march 17, 2021 email from the distributor \nexecutive, ballout knew or was severely reckless in  not knowing that this statement in the march \n9, 2021 press release was false or misleading at th e time it was made. yet, ballout never disclosed \nany of the facts in the march 17, 2021 email quoted  above, and never disclosed the fact that the \ndistributor contacted enerkon de manding that it take down the fa lse and misleading statements \nabout agent’s supposed distribution rights.  case 9:24-cv-81170-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 09/23/2024   page 8 of 22 9 \n 26. on may 11, 2021, enerkon issued another pr ess release—which ballout authored \nand approved—that contained fa lse and misleading statements and omissions concerning a \nfabricated order for the covid-19 test.  \n27. in relevant part, the may 11, 2021 press re lease stated that enerkon “announce[d] \ntoday its first contingent order for the sars2 covid19 15 second ‘insta test’ as produced by \n[manufacturer] with co sales via [distribut or] and [agent] (an [enerkon] wholly owned \ndivision).” the release quoted ba llout as saying that the “‘orde r was placed by an ngo operating \nin the dominican republic from a major medi cal foundation’” and was valued at “‘$28,000,000 \nper month’” or “‘$320 million annually.’” the rel ease further quoted ballout as saying that the \norder was “‘a great start for the new company ac quisition of [agent] and its co sales partner \n[distributor] in canada, the main di stributor with [ma nufacturer].’”   \n28. as an initial matter, th e may 11, 2021 press release was false or misleading, \nbecause ballout knowingly or severely recklessly  failed to disclose the facts discussed in \nparagraphs 22-25 above, including th at agent lacked distribution ri ghts to the covid 19 test, that \ndistributor sent him the marc h 17, 2021 email describe d in paragraph 24 a bove, or any of the \nmaterial facts stated in th at march 17, 2021 email.   \n29. further, the may 11, 2021 press release wa s false, because there was no multi-\nmillion-dollar order for the covid-19  test or, for that matter, any order at all.  on april 14, 2021, \nzayed received an email at his email address fro m an email address associated with a purported \nnon-governmental organization operating in the dominican republic (the “ ngo ”). the email \nattached a letter of interest (“ loi”), dated april 15, 2021, purportedl y from the director of the \nngo. the loi contained a purchase order for covid-19 tests matching the description in \nenerkon’s may 11, 2021 press release.  case 9:24-cv-81170-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 09/23/2024   page 9 of 22 10 \n 30. the loi showed that it had been copied to zayed and li sted a website purportedly \nassociated with the ngo. records from the webs ite’s domain hosts, however, show that this \nwebsite has not been linked to any entity cal led by the given name of the ngo. instead, these \nrecords list zayed and fielding as the contacts for the ngo website and show fielding’s credit \ncard as the payment method. therefor e, the reasonable inference is that zayed fabricated the loi \nand purchase order, then sent an  email from the ngo email address (t hat he controlled) to himself \nwith the fake loi and purchase order on april 14, 2021. zayed then forwarded the email and loi \nhe purportedly received from the ngo to the distributor.  \n31. after receiving the fake loi, the distributor never accepted the supposed order \nreferenced in the press release. because distributo r never accepted the orde r, the order could never \ngenerate any revenue even if it wa s legitimate (which it was not).  \n32. ballout authored and authorized the pres s release, which referenced the fake \npurchase order that he had no way of knowing about  other than through zayed, with whom he had \na longstanding relationship that pre-dated enerkon. ballout also had access and authority to use \nfielding’s credit card that was used to pay for the website associated with the ngo. ballout knew \nor was severely reckless in not knowing that the loi/purchase order was not  legitimate, that the \ndistributor did not accept the lo i/purchase order, and that the loi/purchase order could not \ngenerate any revenue for agent. yet, neither ball out nor enerkon disclosed these material facts in \nthe may 11, 2021 press release or any subse quent press release or public filings.  \niii. ballout made false and misleading statem ents and omissions in an enerkon press \nrelease concerning a power plant that enerkon allegedly planned to build.  \n \n33. on may 3, 2021, enerkon issued a press release—which ballout authored and \napproved—quoting ballout as stat ing, “[t]oday, [enerkon] is pleased to announce the signed \nagreement to purchase of 122 acres [sic] of comm ercial land in pennsylvania turnpike area for case 9:24-cv-81170-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 09/23/2024   page 10 of 22 11 \n the establishment of our planned 20 mw solar a nd hydrogen plant facility.” this press release \nwas false and misleading.   \n34. the “commercial land” referenced in the press release was actually zoned \nresidential, not commercial. according to the zoning office r for penn forest township, \npennsylvania, where the land was located, the to wnship never received any correspondence, re-\nzoning applications, or other documents from enerkon relating to any plan to  build an energy plant \nthere. enerkon also l acked the funds to build  a 20 mw solar and hydroge n plant. in addition, \nenerkon never paid the landowner anyt hing, according to the landowner.  \n35. the may 3, 2021 press release also incl uded a picture purporting to depict \nenerkon’s future solar and hydrogen plant. as presented and captione d, the picture gives the false \nand misleading impression of an act ual plant that enerkon had plans to  build. in reality, the picture \nin the press release depicts a pl ant located in japan that is one  of the world’s largest hydrogen-\nproducing facilities—a fact that is not disclosed in the press re lease or any of enerkon’s other \npublic filings.  \n36. ballout knew or was severely reckless in  not knowing that the may 3, 2021 press \nrelease contained the false and misleading statem ents described in paragraphs 33-35 above. he \nalso knowingly or severely recklessl y failed to disclose the material  facts described in paragraphs \n33-35 above in the may 3, 2021 press release or any other public fili ng or statement.  \niv. statements concerning enerkon’s financial condition \n \n37. ballout caused enerkon to report on its ba lance sheet in its otc disclosures and \nfinancial statements that enerkon had millions in  “cash.” for example, enerkon’s balance sheet \nincluded in its june 30, 2018 otc disclosure re ported more than $65 million in “cash.”  case 9:24-cv-81170-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 09/23/2024   page 11 of 22 12 \n 38. at the time of these statements and di sclosures, enerkon never had more than $100 \ncash in its bank account. ballout te stified that the cash balance de scribed above was deferred (or \nunearned) revenue. but enerkon’s fi nancial statements and otc disc losures did not disclose that \nthe reported cash balance described above  was either deferred or unearned.  \n39. as further discussed below, fielding purportedly made a $180 ,000 loan to enerkon \npursuant to a convertible promissory note date d and signed by ballout, on behalf of enerkon, on \nnovember 30, 2017. in 2021, fielding converted the note to enerkon stock, which he sold for a \nprofit of at least $407,000. however, certain of enerkon’s otc disclosures and financial \nstatements after the note was purportedly signe d by ballout in november 2017 do not disclose \nfielding’s purported $180,000 loan or his conver tible promissory note. for example, enerkon’s \ndecember 31, 2018 otc disclosure and its ju ne 30, 2019 quarterly otc disclosure—both of \nwhich ballout signed and approved—do not disclose  the loan or note. in  enerkon’s september 30, \n2019 quarterly otc disclosure—which ballo ut signed and approved—enerkon publicly \ndisclosed the purported loan and note.   \n40. ballout’s false and misleading statements  and omissions were material. they \ncreated false and misleading impressions abou t enerkon’s financial condition and lucrative \nbusiness opportunities that di d not actually exist.  \n41. zayed knowingly or severely recklessly enga ged in one or more deceptive acts in \nfurtherance of ballout’s scheme to artificially inflate the price of enerkon’s stock. for example, \nzayed knew, or was severely reckless in not know ing, that at least the march 9, 2021 and may 11, \n2021 press releases were false a nd misleading. on march 17, 2021, a distributor  executive copied \nzayed on the email to ballout referenced in pa ragraph 24 above stating that agent did not own \nany distribution rights to the covid-19 test, as represented in the march 9, 2021 release. case 9:24-cv-81170-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 09/23/2024   page 12 of 22 13 \n subsequently, as discussed in paragraphs 29-32 above, zayed created a website for a fictitious \nngo in the dominican republic, fabricated a bogus loi, and emailed the bogus loi to the \ndistributor in connection with the alleged purchase order tout ed in the may 11, 2021 release. \n42. ballout’s fraudulent scheme, and false a nd misleading statements and omissions, \nartificially inflated the pric e of enerkon’s stock. for example,  on march 8, 2021, enerkon’s stock \nprice closed at $0.87 per share; after the issuance of the false and misleading press release on \nmarch 9, 2021, enerkon’s stock price closed at $0.93 per share, an increase of roughly 6.9%. \ninvestors bought or sold enerkon securities during the course of  ballout’s fraudulent scheme, \nmisstatements, and omissions, and suffere d pecuniary harm as a result.   \nc. defendants schemed to convert a bogus prom issory note issued to fielding into \nshares of enerkon and sell those shares at inflated prices.  \n43. between at least may 2019 and june 2021, in  coordination with ballout’s scheme \nto pump enerkon’s stock price, defendants engage d in a fraudulent scheme  to: (1) create a bogus \npromissory note purportedly issued by enerkon to fielding, (2) convert that bogus note to shares \nof enerkon stock, and (3) sell those shares to a third party at inflated prices.  \n44. the bogus note was purportedly issued as  consideration for a $180,000 loan that \nfielding allegedly made to enerkon on or before  november 30, 2017. the note, which identifies \nfielding as the creditor and ener kon as the debtor, was purportedly si gned by ballout on behalf of \nenerkon on november 30, 2017. the not e provided that enerkon was obl igated to repay fielding \nthe principal sum of $180,000 on or before n ovember 30, 2018. should enerkon fail to timely \nrepay fielding in full, th e note gave fielding the right to convert the note to a designated number \nof shares of enerkon stock. \n45. however, the note was created in furthera nce of the fraudulent scheme. fielding \ndid not loan enerkon $180,000 on or before novemb er 30, 2017 or at any other time. the note case 9:24-cv-81170-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 09/23/2024   page 13 of 22 14 \n was also backdated. it appears that the note was actually created and signed on or about may 9, \n2019, when fielding received an email from an “e nerkon international” em ail address attaching \nthe “final signed” promissory note. ballout  purportedly signed th e note as enerkon’s \n“chairman” on november 30, 2017, but  in fact, he did not become  affiliated with enerkon until \nfebruary 2018—more than two months after the da te he purportedly signed the note. also, in \nenerkon’s september 30, 2019 quar terly otc disclosure, enerkon publicly disclosed the \npurported loan and note. but enerkon’s otc di sclosures prior to september 30, 2019 do not \ndisclose or mention the purported note and loan. that includes, for example, enerkon’s december \n31, 2018 otc disclosure and its june 30, 2019 qu arterly otc disclosure, neither of which \ndisclosed the purported loan and note.   \n46. fielding subsequently took steps to conve rt the bogus note into  shares of enerkon \nstock. on march 20, 2021, enerkon’s transfer agent r eceived documents relating to the conversion \nof fielding’s bogus promissory note from fieldi ng’s email account. attached  to that email were \ndocuments purporting to be evidence of the alleged $180,000 loan to enerkon, including (a) an \ninvoice enerkon purportedly issued to fieldi ng for three payments totaling $180,000, and \n(b) fielding’s purported bank account statement, which listed three payments to enerkon in \noctober 2017 totaling $180,000, consistent with the enerkon invoice. howeve r, fielding’s bank \nstatement was fabricated. his actua l bank statement from this period does not reflect these three \npayments. in truth, fielding never paid $180,000 to  or on behalf of enerkon in or around october \n2017, and the statement that was sent to enerkon’s  transfer agent from fi elding’s email account \nsupporting his request to  obtain enerkon shares  was fabricated.  \n47. in the march 20, 2021 email to  enerkon’s transfer agen t from fielding’s email \naccount, a debt conversion notice an d seller’s representation letter we re attached, both of which case 9:24-cv-81170-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 09/23/2024   page 14 of 22 15 \n fielding signed. the debt conversion notice falsel y represented that the bogus promissory note \nwas entered into in november 2017. the seller’s representation le tter falsely represented that \nthe note was entered into in november 2017 and th at fielding’s shares were acquired through a \nloan to enerkon that, in fact, he never made.  \n48. ballout acted knowingly or with severe recklessness in furtherance of the bogus \nnote scheme. for example, ballout executed the b ogus promissory note as chairman of enerkon, \neven though the note was backdated and, as of th e purported date of th e note (november 30, 2017), \nhe had no affiliation with enerkon or authority to  issue a promissory note on enerkon’s behalf. on \nor around march 20, 2021, ballout em ailed enerkon’s transf er agent and atta ched a march 19, \n2021 “issuance resolution” (which he signed as “c eo” of enerkon) falsely representing that the \npromissory note was issued to fielding on november 30, 2017.  \n49. on or around may 11, 2021, ba llout emailed enerkon’s tran sfer agent and wrote in \nthe subject line: “final conversi on of note for fielding documents attached as per his request and \nour permission.” ballout attached to that email to  the transfer agent, among other things, the bogus \nnote as well as an enerkon board resolution and debt conversion notice, both of which were \ndated may 9, 2021, signed by ballout, and falsely represented that on november 30, 2017 the \nbogus note was issued to fielding and that  enerkon incurred the underlying debt.  \n50. likewise, zayed acted knowingl y or with severe recklessn ess, in coordination with \nfielding and ballout, in furthe rance of defendants’ bogus pro missory note scheme. fielding \ntestified that he believed zayed prepared at least some of the documents that fielding sent to \nenerkon’s transfer agent in connection with the conversion of the bogus promissory note. \nsimilarly, emails between zayed and fielding furt her indicate that zaye d prepared—or directed \nlawyers or other professionals to prepare—ot her

shar es, including but not limited to \nlegal opinions, affidavits, letter s, and agreements. zayed sent t hose documents to fielding for his \nreview, approval, and, when necessary, his signature.  \n51. as a further example of zayed’s involv ement, zayed emailed fielding on or around \njanuary 10, 2021 to provide fielding with a status report on the conve rsion of the bogus  promissory \nnote to enerkon shares. zayed listed  a number of steps that were ei ther planned or completed to \neffectuate the conversio n, including the issuance of an en erkon “corporate reso lution last year \ndated to comply with the holding period” and docume nts that needed to be prepared and sent to \nthe transfer agent. he also advised fielding ab out the timing of when they should try to sell \nfielding’s enerkon shares to maxi mize their return. following this upda te and list of next steps, \nzayed told fielding that once they finished thei r current set of transactions, then “we will get \nmore free shares from ben [ballout] th en after that and do it again .…”  \n52. as a result of the documents sent to enerkon’s transfer agent discussed in \nparagraphs 46-49 above, fielding successfully c onverted the bogus promissory note to at least \n9,000,000 unrestricted shares of enerkon stock.   \n53. ballout and zayed then negotiated the sale  of fielding’s stock with a third-party \ninvestor who purchased the shar es.  for example, on february 24, 2021, ballout emailed the third-\nparty investor, thanking the investor  for the offer to fiel ding, but noting that he  “would be insulting \nhim [fielding]” if he shared it with fiel ding. on march 5, 2021, zayed—holding himself out as \nan advisor to fielding and enerkon —emailed the third-party invest or and conveyed that fielding \nwanted to wait to sell his enerkon stock until th ere were “better market conditions.” just days \nlater—on march 9, 2021— enerkon issued the pre ss release announcing the distribution rights \npurportedly owned by agent, discus sed in paragraphs 22-25 above. case 9:24-cv-81170-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 09/23/2024   page 16 of 22 17 \n 54. weeks later,

paragraphs 17- 42 above, receiving a to tal profit of $407,000.  \n55. before the sale, fielding agreed to provi de zayed a share of the sales proceeds. \ntrue to his word, fielding sent zayed $96,000 from the sales proceeds following the sale. \n56. fielding also entered into an agreement w ith a third-party invest or on or about june \n7, 2021 to sell additional enerkon shares for $569,000, but it does not appear that he received \npayment pursuant to this agreement.    \nvi. claims for relief \nfirst claim for relief \nviolations of sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the securities act [15 u.s.c.

(the “fund”).  in total, mausner and \nevolution raised approxima tely $413,000 from at least 11 investors across multiple \nstates.   \n5. defendants sold interests in the fund through false and misleading \nstatements and omissions regarding mausne r’s disciplinary history and crypto asset-\nrelated investments.  for ex ample, they informed investors that mausner was the \nprincipal of evolution and ha d “30 years of experience in the financial advisory and \nmoney management industry,” but conveniently failed to mention that the sec had \npreviously barred him from the securities industr y.  further, they told investors that \nthe fund would invest in crypto assets and hold them at specific crypto asset trading \nplatforms; however, defenda nts never held any fund -related assets on those \nplatforms.   case 3:25-cv-01591-btm-vet     document 1     filed 06/23/25     pageid.2     page 2 of 24  \n 3  \n 1\n23456789\n101112131415161718192021222324252627286. in addition to making false and mi sleading representations, defendants \nalso deposited the money that investors cont ributed to the fund to evolution’s bank \naccounts and mausner’s personal bank accounts, mixing—or commingling—fund \nassets with completely unrelated  assets in the process.   \n7. throughout this period, defendants , each acting as an investment \nadviser under section 202(a)(11) of th e advisers act, 15 u.s.c. §80b-2(a)(11), \nreceived ill-gotten management and performance fees for services that they promised, \nbut never provided.  in so doing, mausne r not only violated the antifraud provisions \nof the securities laws, he also violated the aforementioned industry/associational bar \nby acting as an investment adviser.   \n8. in addition to violating the antifraud provisions of the exchange act and \nsecurities act, defendants’ false and mi sleading statements and commingling of \ninvestor funds breached their fiduciary du ties to the fund as investment advisers, \nincluding their duties of\n utmost good faith and full and fair  disclosure of all material \nfacts, and their affirmative obligation to employ reasonable care to avoid misleading \nthe fund, in violation of the adviser act’s antifraud provisions .   \n9. on top of this, defendants never re gistered their fraudulent offering of \ninterests in the fund with the sec, a nd no exemptions from the registration \nrequirement applied to the offering.  fo r example, mausner a nd evolution offered \nand sold to individuals they did not kno w, through general solic itation, and failed to \nverify whether any of the investor s were accredited investors.   \n10. by engaging in this conduc t, defendants violated sections 5(a), 5(c) and \n17(a) of the securities act, 15 u.s.c. §§ 77e (a), 77e(c), and 77q(a) , section 10(b) of \nthe exchange act, 15 u.s.c. § 78j(b), rule  10b-5 thereunder, 17 c.f.r. § 240.10b-5, \nsections 206(1) and 206(2) of the advise rs act, 15 u.s.c. §§ 80b-6(1) & 80b-6(2), \nand rule 206(4)-8 thereunder,  17 c.f.r. § 275.206(4)-8.  alternatively, pursuant to \nsection 15(b) of the securities act, secti on 20(e) of the exchange act, and section \n209(f) of the advisers act, mausner aided a nd abetted evolution in its violation of case 3:25-cv-01591-btm-vet     document 1     filed 06/23/25     pageid.3     page 3 of 24  \n 4  \n 1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728these securities laws provisions. \n11. accordingly, the sec seeks an or der against defendants permanently \nenjoining them from future violations of  these provisions, requiring them to pay \ndisgorgement plus prejudgment interest on any ill-gotten gains, and to pay civil \nmonetary penalties.  \nthe defendants \n12. ian o.  mausner, age 64, resides in san diego,  ca.  mausner previously \nfounded and operated j.s. o liver capital management, l. p.

order 2 further \nfound that mausner misuse d the money that was accrued from trading commissions \npaid by j.s. oliver clients (known as “sof t dollars”); specifically, he had used soft \ndollars to pay his ex-wife pursuant to his personal obligations in a divorce settlement, \ninflated rent payments to a company that he himself owned, a nd maintenance fees on \nmausner’s personal timeshare  property, all without disclosing such payments.  id.   \nb. mausner and evolution establish the fund \n20. despite mausner’s prior di sciplinary history and his investment industry \nbar, at all relevant times, mausner and evolution served as  investment advisers within \nthe meaning of section 202(a)(11) of the advisers act [15 u.s.c. §§ 80b-2(a)11)].  \nthat is, they both, for compensation, enga ged in the business of advising others, \neither directly or through publications and wr itings, as to the value of securities or as \nto the advisability of investing in , purchasing or selling securities.   \n21. specifically, in or around february  2018, mausner be gan selling limited \npartnership interests to potential investor s in the fund.  the ppm, which mausner \nemailed to investors, listed evolution as th e general partner and noted that evolution \nhad “discretion to invest in a broad and wi de variety of investment opportunities that \nstand to benefit directly or indirectly from the expanding crypt ocurrency industry and \nrelated business opportunities.”   \n22. the ppm also listed mausner as evolu tion’s principal, and stated that \n“[i]n making investment decisions,” fund i nvestors would have to “rely on the advice \nand analysis of the general partner rath er than any specific objective criteria.”  \n23. from around december 2020 to january  2022, mausner sold limited \npartnership interests in the fund to approx imately 11 investors, receiving in exchange \ncapital contributions tota ling about $413,000.   \n24. mausner controlled the funds that thes e investors contributed to the fund \nas capital.  indeed, mausner—as its prin cipal and owner—exerte d total control over case 3:25-cv-01591-btm-vet     document 1     filed 06/23/25     pageid.7     page 7 of 24  \n 8  \n 1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728evolution, including having sole contro l over evolution’s bank accounts and \ninvestment decisions.   \n25. according to the ppm, investors were required to pay evolution “a \nquarterly management fee . . . equal to 0. 50% (2% annually)” of total commitments to \nthe fund, as well as a “performance fee e qual to 20% of the profits earned for each \ncalendar year.”   \nc. violations of the antifraud provi sions:  misrepresentations and \nscheme liability  \n1. defendants’ false and misleading statements to investors \na. false and misleading statements about mausner’s \ndisciplinary history \n26. mausner, whose conduct is imputed to evolution, offered and sold \nlimited partnership interests in the fund base d, in part, on representations that he \nmade to investors in the ppm.   \n27. mausner emailed the ppms directly to  prospective fund investors, and \ninvestors executed subscription agreements  to purchase interests in the fund.  \nmausner countersigned those agreements—w hich incorporated the ppm’s terms and \nconditions—as evolutio n’s manager.   \n28. mausner, as the principal, owner, and manager of evolution who exerted \ntotal control over the entity, was the maker of  the statements in the ppm because he \nhad ultimate authority over the content of  the ppm and whether and how the ppm \nwas communicated to prospective fund investors. \n29. the ppm contained materially fals e and misleading statements.  for \nexample, it highlighted the fact that mausne r had more than 30 years of experience in \nthe advisory business, founded j.s. oliver , and had held prominent positions in the \nfinancial advisory and m oney management industry.  these statements were \nmaterially misleading because they failed to  disclose mausner’s disciplinary history \nfor fraudulent conduct, as laid out in j.s. o liver order 1 and j.s. oliver order 2.   case 3:25-cv-01591-btm-vet     document 1     filed 06/23/25     pageid.8     page 8 of 24  \n 9  \n 1\n23456789\n1011121314151617181920212223242526272830. additionally, while the ppm represen ted that mausner was the principal \nof evolution, it failed to disclose that  in 2016, the commission barred mausner from \nassociating with any investme nt adviser or acting as an  investment adviser.   \n31. mausner, whose conduct is imputed to evolution, also made materially \nfalse and misleading statements outside of  the ppm, as he failed to disclose his \ndisciplinary history to investors when a dvising and reassuring them regarding their \ninvestments, and when actually confront ed about his disciplinary history.   \n32. for example, in may 2022, when an investor confronted mausner via \ntext that he had been barred by the se c from acting as a broker or investment \nadviser, mausner falsely res ponded: “i won my case w ith the sec in the supreme \ncourt.  it was expunged.”  ma usner also falsely told the investor: “true that i can’t \nwork for a firm but i can for myself.  but read the settlement agreement!  won the \nsupreme court outright and settled remainder with no ad mission of wrong doing.”   \n33. the statements that mausner made to this investor were materially false \nand misleading because the j.s. oliver case  never reached the supreme court of the \nunited states, was never e xpunged, and concluded with  a settled commission order \nfinding that mausner had enga ged in securities and inve stment advisor fraud, and \nbarring him from the securities industry.      \nb. false and misleading statements about the handling of \nfunds  \n34. mausner also made statements in the ppm that were mate rially false and \nmisleading with respect to how evolution w ould use investor funds.  specifically, the \nppm represented that the fund sought to cr eate a portfolio “to benefit from the rapid \ngrowth and burgeoning acceptance of cr yptocurrencies” and the fund would hold \nthese crypto assets for the fund’s benef it at “coinbase,” a crypto asset trading \nplatform.         \n35. in april 2021, mausner supplemented th e representations he made in the \nppm regarding coinbase serving as the custod ian when he told an investor via email case 3:25-cv-01591-btm-vet     document 1     filed 06/23/25     pageid.9     page 9 of 24  \n 10  \n 1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728that the fund’s crypto assets were be ing held by “robinhoo d, bitstamp, and \ncoinbase . . . the primary ‘custody’  agents in the crypto world.”   \n36. together, these statements that maus ner made to the investor regarding \nthe use of investor funds were materia lly false and misleading because the fund \nnever held any assets, le t alone any crypto assets, in accounts at coinbase, \nrobinhood, or bitstamp, for th e benefit of the fund.    \n2. defendants engaged in a scheme to defraud \n37. mausner, whose conduct again is imput ed to evolution, not only made \nmaterially false and misleading statements to the fund invest ors, he also engaged in a \nscheme to defraud in which he raised hundreds of thousands of dollars: (i) when \nconcealing the fact that j.s. oliver orde r 1 and j.s. oliver order 2 had found that \nmausner perpetrated inter alia a $10 million cherry-picking scheme at his prior \nadvisory firm and accordingl y barred him from the investment advisory industry; (ii) \nthrough misrepresenting that fund assets woul d be invested in crypto assets held for \nthe benefit of the fund at well-known trad ing platforms; and (iii) by disseminating \nthese false and misleading statements to investors.     \n38. in furtherance of their scheme, de fendants engaged in  further deceptive \nacts when commingling the fund’s assets in a group of bank accounts that mausner \ncontrolled, namely evolution’s bank ac counts and mausner’s  own personal bank \naccounts.  as a result, these bank account s contained both investor money and money \nfrom sources completely unrelated to the fund.   \n39. for example: \n(a) at mausner’s direction, an inve stor wired $150,000 to evolution’s \npacific premier bank account on decemb er 28, 2020, which account contained \nmoney unrelated to the fund. \n(b) at mausner’s direction, an inve stor wired $55,000 to mausner’s \npersonal u.s. bank account on october 14,  2021, which account contained money \nunrelated to the fund.   case 3:25-cv-01591-btm-vet     document 1     filed 06/23/25     pageid.10     page 10 of\n24  \n 11  \n 1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728(c) at mausner’s direction, an inve stor wired $20,000 to evolution’s \nu.s. bank account on july 1, 2021, which ac count contained money unrelated to the \nfund. \n(d) at mausner’s direction, an inve stor wired $10,000 to mausner’s \npersonal comerica bank account on janu ary 18, 2022, which account contained \nmoney unrelated to the fund.   \n40. by august 2021, mausner had moved a ll the funds in evolution’s bank \naccounts—which still had investor capital contributions—to maus ner’s personal bank \naccounts.   \nd. defendants’ commingling of investor funds violated their \nfiduciary duties as investment advisers \n41. as set forth above, at all relevant  times, mausner and evolution were \ninvestment advisers within the meaning of section 202(a)(11) of the advisers act [15 \nu.s.c. §§ 80b-2(a)11)], since they both, for compensation, engaged in the business of \nadvising others—in this case a pooled investme nt vehicle—either directly or through \npublications and writings, as to the value of securities or as to the advisability of \ninvesting in, purchasing or selling securities.  specifically:  \n(a) the ppm made it clear that defe ndants advised the fund on its \ninvestments, explicitly stating that: “in making investment decisions, the [fund] will \nrely on the advice and analysis of [evolu tion] rather than any specific objective \ncriteria.”  as such, evolution and mausne r, as evolution’s principal, owner and \nmanager, advised on—and wa s responsible for making—por tfolio management and \ninvestment decisions on behalf of the fund.  \n(b) the fund was a pooled investment vehicle because it held itself \nout as being primarily engaged in the bus iness of investing in securities.   \n(c) further, defendants were entitled to fees for their investment \nadviser services on behalf of the fund, an d mausner also received compensation as \nprincipal, owner, and ma nager of evolution.   case 3:25-cv-01591-btm-vet     document 1     filed 06/23/25     pageid.11     page 11 of\n24  \n 12  \n 1\n23456789\n1011121314151617181920212223242526272842. as investment advisers, defendants owed to the fund a fiduciary duty of \nutmost good faith and full and fair disclosure  of all material facts.  the defendants \nalso had an affirmative obligation to em ploy reasonable care to avoid misleading the \nfund.  indeed, even the ppm assured i nvestors that evolution would “act in good \nfaith and in the best interest of the [fund], pursuant to its fiduciary duty.”   \n43. despite these fiduciary duties a nd obligations, mausner knowingly, \nrecklessly, and negligently commingled th e fund’s assets in both evolution’s and \nmausner’s own bank accounts, creating an  undisclosed conflict of interest, and—\nthrough evolution and separa tely—made material misrepresentations and omissions \nto fund investors, in violation of their duties.  \ne. the false and misleading stat ements defendants made were \nmaterial \n44. mausner and evolution’s false and misleading statements to investors \nwere material.   \n45. a reasonable investor would have c onsidered it important when making \nan investment decision to know that maus ner’s “30 years of experience” included a \ndisciplinary history for fraudulent c onduct, including his being barred from \nassociating with any investment adviser or acting as an investment adviser. \n46. a reasonable investor also would ha ve considered it important when \nmaking an investment decision to know that that their money was not being used for \nthe crypto asset-related investment purpose specified in the ppm.     \n47. a reasonable investor would also ha ve considered it important when \nmaking an investment decision to know that  the fund did not hold any crypto assets \nat the crypto asset trading platform specifi ed in the ppm, or any other platform \nmausner told them would be used as the custodian.   \n48. finally, a reasonable investor would have considered it important to \nknow when making an investment decision that their funds were being commingled case 3:25-cv-01591-btm-vet     document 1     filed 06/23/25     pageid.12     page 12 of\n24  \n 13  \n 1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728with evolution’s and mausner’s bank account s, where deposits of money unrelated to \nthe fund and withdrawals of money unrelated  to the fund were made.        \nf. defendants acted with scienter a nd their conduct was negligent \n49. mausner knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that his and evolution’s \naforementioned statements to investors we re materially false and misleading.  \nfurther, in making these statements, mausne r failed to behave w ith the level of care \nthat a reasonable person would have exer cised under the same circumstances, and \nwas thus negligent.  mausner’s state of  mind and negligent conduct are imputed to \nevolution.   \n50. further, mausner knew, or was r eckless for not knowing, that \ncommingling investor funds with non-investor funds created a conflict of interest and \nviolated his fiduciary duties to the fund.  by  commingling investor funds in this way, \nmausner failed to behave with  the level of care that a reasonable person would have \nexercised under the same circ umstances, and his conduct wa s therefore negligent.  \nmausner’s state of mind and negligent conduct are imputed to evolution.   \n51. mausner’s scienter and failure to act  reasonably under the circumstances \nis demonstrated, in part, by the following:  \n(a) even though j.s. oliver order 1 and j.s. oliver order 2 \nprohibited him from committing further violati ons of the federal securities laws and \nserving as/associating with an investment a dviser, mausner continued to do all these \nthings as described above.   \n(b) when an investor confronted mausner via text about his past \ndisciplinary history, mausner falsely told the investor that he had won the j.s. oliver \ncase at the supreme court, resulting in the case being expunged, when in reality he \nhad recently entered into a settlement barring him from the securities industry.      \n(c) mausner falsely told an investor th at the fund’s crypto assets were \nstored on various crypto asset trading plat forms, even though he knew that evolution \ndid not hold any crypto assets on the platforms.   case 3:25-cv-01591-btm-vet     document 1     filed 06/23/25     pageid.13     page 13 of\n24  \n 14  \n 1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728(d) mausner deliberately commingled investor money with unrelated \nfunds, including personal funds and, over time, moved all the m oney in evolution’s \nbank accounts to mausner’s pe rsonal bank accounts.   \ng. registration violations: sections 5(a)  and 5(c) of the securities act  \n52. the limited partnership interests in the fund that defendants offered and \nsold are securities.   \n53. the investors committed money to purch ase limited partnership interests \nin the fund.   \n54. mausner pooled the investor funds in to several bank accounts that he \ncontrolled.   \n55. investors relied on mausner to invest  their funds and had no expectation \nthat they would be required to participate in efforts to generate the returns.   \n56. in fact, the fund’s ppm stated that evolution would “exclusively” make \n“[a]ll decisions regarding the management a nd affairs of the partnership” and that \n“the success of the partnership for the foreseeable future de pends solely on the \nabilities of [evolution].” \n57. as set forth above, mausner also misleadingly touted his extensive \ntrading acumen and strategy to generate profits and repres ented that he would make \nall investment decisions for the fund.   \n58. no registration statements were file d with the commission in connection \nwith the fund offering, and no exemptions to  the registration requirement applied to \nthe fund offering, as defendants: \n(a) engaged in a general so licitation when offering shares of the fund;  \n(b) offered and sold securities to i nvestors in multiple states; and \n(c) failed to take reasonable steps to verify whether investors were \naccredited.   \n59. even if they had done all these th ings, mausner was disqualified from \nparticipating in a registered offering beca use he was a “bad act or”—pursuant to rule case 3:25-cv-01591-btm-vet     document 1     filed 06/23/25     pageid.14     page 14 of\n24  \n 15  \n 1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728506

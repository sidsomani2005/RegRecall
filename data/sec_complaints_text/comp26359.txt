knight-swift. the insider knew that the in formation about the potential acquisition was 
material and nonpublic and trus ted his friend to keep the information confidential. the 
insider did not expect his friend to trad e on the material nonpublic information.

of the material nonpublic info rmation he misappropriated fro m his long-time friend, the

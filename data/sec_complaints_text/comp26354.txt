facts  
i. background 
15. d’ambrosio formed hereford in 1997 to pool and manage investments from  his 
family and friends.   case 1:25-cv-05884     document 1     filed 07/17/25     page 4 of 15    
 5 16. d’ambrosio, his wife, and his children’s trusts initially contributed to hereford 
approximately $750,000.  
17. in addition to receiving his immediate family’s personal money for hereford , 
d’ambrosio accepted money from friends and other family members , including his wife’s 
parents, his childhood best friend, and his wife’s aunt . 
18. according to hereford holdings’ limited liability company agreement 
(“hereford llc agreement”), hereford ’s mission  was “to serve as a fund through which the 
assets of [hereford’s] members [would] be utilized to invest, hold and trade in securities and 
other financial instruments and rights relating thereto, either directly or indirectly.”   
19. the hereford llc agreement designated  d’ambrosio as hereford’s  “managing 
member ” and , thus,  authorized d’ambrosio, on behalf of hereford,  to, among other things,  
“purchase, hold, sell, sell short and otherwise deal in securities ;” “to open, maintain and close 
bank accounts, borrow money against a pledge of assets and draw checks or other orders for the 
payment of moneys ;” “to open, maintain and close brokerage accounts ;” and to “act for 
[hereford] in all other matters .” 
20. at all relevant times, as hereford’s managing member, d’ambrosio made all 
investment decisions on behalf of hereford.     
21. none of the powers  enumerated  in the hereford llc agreement  authorized  
d’ambrosio to spend hereford investor money for his personal use.  
22. as president and managing member of investment adviser a , d’ambrosio also 
had sole responsibility for the investment decisions of investment adviser a.   case 1:25-cv-05884     document 1     filed 07/17/25     page 5 of 15    
 6 ii. d’ambrosio’s fraudulent scheme  
 
a. hereford  managed money of d’ambrosio’s family and friends  
 
23. starting in 1998, hereford raised  millions of dollars from  approximately 19 
investors – all of whom were d’ambrosio’s family members or  friends .  
24. hereford did not charge its investors any fees  to manage their money .  
25. at the time they invested , d’ambrosio represented to hereford’s investors , both 
orally and in writing , that he would invest their money in equities.  
26. after the formation of investment adviser a, hereford’s primary  investment was 
in investment adviser a’s hedge funds : hedge fund 1 (from 2000 to its wind -down in 2010), 
hedge fund 2 (from 2006 to its win d-down in 2010), and hedge fund 3 (from 2011 to 
hereford’s exit in 2023) (collectively, the “hedge funds”) . 
27. investors , or limited partners,  in the hedge funds included hereford and  other , 
non-hereford  investors .1   
28. d’ambrosio sent hereford investors individualized, semiannual investor letters 
(“investor letter s”), which purported to report  the value of the individual hereford investments.   
29. by 2011, when d’ambrosio invested hereford funds in hedge fund 3, hedge 
funds 1 and 2 had been wound down, and their remaining assets had been distributed to their 
limited partners  (including hereford).  
30. hereford made only one  capital contribution to hedge fund 3 (in 2011) , and it 
made no additional capital contributions to hedge fund 3.  
 
1 the commission does not allege in this complaint that the non- hereford investors  in the hedge funds  
were victims of d’ambrosio’s fraud.    case 1:25-cv-05884     document 1     filed 07/17/25     page 6 of 15
    
 7 b. d’ambrosio used hereford investor money for his personal expenses  
31. by at least 2010,  d’ambrosio was withdraw ing investor money from hereford to 
pay his personal expenses, including his mortgage, real estate taxes, and  travel.   d’ambrosio 
generally did so by writing checks from hereford’s bank account to himself and depositing  the 
checks  into his personal bank account s.   
32. when hereford’s bank accounts lacke d sufficient cash to cover d’ambrosio’s 
personal expenses , d’ambrosio liquidate d hereford’s equities holdings , including by causing 
hereford to request redemptions from the h edge  funds.   after the h edge funds wired hereford 
its redemption money, d’ambrosio withdr ew it from hereford’s bank account  and deposited it 
into his personal bank accounts . 
33. although hereford’s investors included d’ambrosio, his wife , and his children,  
d’ambrosio did not attribute his cash withdrawals from hereford to any particular investor  and, 
over time, he withdrew far more cash from hereford than he and his immediate family had 
invested in hereford.    
c. d’ambrosio made misrepresentations to investors about the values of their 
investments in hereford  
34. d’ambrosio falsely represent ed to the hereford investors the value  of their 
holdings , calculating it as if he had not  withdrawn  their mone y from the h edge funds .   
35. for example, in february 2010, d’ambrosio represented to an investor  (“investor 
a”) that, due to the alleged positive performance of hedge funds  1 and 2  in 2009,  the value of 
her interest in hereford had increased by 21.8% , to $1,990,286.   as d’ambrosio knew or 
recklessly disregarded , however, these nav numbers were false because they included money 
that d’ambrosio  had misappropriat ed from hereford .   case 1:25-cv-05884     document 1     filed 07/17/25     page 7 of 15    
 8 36. in may 2016, d’ambrosio wrote  to another  investor  (“investor b”),  who had just 
made an additional contribution to her hereford capital account , “i received your check in 
yesterday’s mail and will put the funds to work.  i feel very good about the way it’s been going 
so far this year.  my research pipeline is full of good ideas.  i will give you the usual mid-year 
update in a couple of months. ”    
37. contrary to his may 2016  statement to investor b, d’ambrosio did not put 
investor b’s “ funds to work. ”  to the contrary, by may 2016, d’ambrosio had already 
withdrawn the vast majority of hereford’s money, and no record exists of hereford making any 
investments  with investor b’s money.  
38. by june 2016, d’ambrosio had largely dissipated hereford’s assets:  hereford 
had approximately $150 in its bank account , approximately $43,000 invested  in hedge fund 3, 
and no other equity investments .   
39. after june 2016, d’ambrosio nonetheless continued to make false representations 
to investors regarding the value and performance of their investments.  
40. for example, on august 2, 2016, d’ambrosio sent a n investor letter to 
investor  a regarding “hereford holdings, llc mid -year 2016 update ,” which stated that “the 
value of your interest in hereford holdings, llc was $2,688,202, representing a -0.9% return 
for the first six months of the year.”   that letter  further stated , “we had a fairly strong first 
quarter, followed by weakness in a few positions in may and june, as the market was roiled by worries over the brexit vote among other concerns.  currently, investment sentiment is generally 
positive, with the s&p 500 index rising to all -time highs in july.”   d’ambrosio knew or 
recklessly disregarded  that the  nav figure  that he reported to i nvestor a was false because it far 
exceeded  the sum total of hereford ’s assets at the time , which amounted to less than $50,000.  case 1:25-cv-05884     document 1     filed 07/17/25     page 8 of 15    
 9 41. after august 2016, d’ambrosio continued to report  fraudulently overstated  nav 
figures to hereford ’s investors by calculat ing them  as if he had fully invested their money in 
hedge fund 3.   in fact , d’ambrosio had not invested hereford funds in hedge fund 3 since 
2011 and continued to request from hedge fund 3 redemptions on behalf of hereford.  
42. by 2023, d’ambrosio knew that he could not  repay the amount  of money that he 
had misappropriated from hereford but nonetheless  continued to report  to hereford investors 
navs and performance  based on the false premise that he had fully invested  his investors’ funds 
in the hedge funds .  thus, a s d’ambrosio knew or recklessly disregarded,  the navs he 
reported  to hereford investors far exceed ed hereford’s  actual assets.  
43. for example , in a july 2023 investor letter to investor a  purporting to provide 
mid-year 2023 results, d’ambrosio falsely wrote : “as of june 30, 2023, the value of your 
interest in hereford holdings, llc was $9 ,878,208 , representing a 9.2% increase since the end 
of 2022.”  in fact, the actual value of hereford ’s total assets was approximately $50,000.  
44. by december 31, 2023, hereford’s capital account balance at hedge fund 3 was 
zero, hereford held only $675 in its bank account , and it held no other investments.   
45. on january 25, 2024, d’ambrosio report ed 2023 end-of-year results to investor  
a, stating  that, “the value of your interest in hereford holdings, llc was $8,229,202, 
representing a 9.0% decrease for the full year of 2023.”   in fact, the actual value of hereford’s 
total assets was less than $1,000.  
46. in 2023, d’ambrosio successfully convinced at least one investor (“investor c”) 
to refrain from redeeming  his investment  in hereford .    case 1:25-cv-05884     document 1     filed 07/17/25     page 9 of 15    
 10 47. in july 2023, d’ambrosio sent investor c a letter stating that the value of his 
hereford investment was $928,907.   as d’ambrosio knew or recklessly disregarded,  that 
$928,907 figure was false  because it far exceeded all of hereford’s money.  
48. at the same time, d’ambrosio  falsely advised investor c that hedge fund 3 
would perform better in 2024, thus convinc ing investor  c to refrain from redeem ing his hereford 
investment in 2023.    
49. in fact, at the time he was communicating with investor  c, d’ambrosio knew or 
recklessly disregarded that hereford lacked the money  to meet investor c’s redemption request.  
50. in 2024, d’ambrosio continued to misstate  to hereford’s investors the value of 
their holdings.   
51. for example, in july 2024, d’ambrosio sent a mid -year report to investor c , 
which claimed  that the nav of investor c’s investment had increased by 7.5% since year -end 
2023.   in fact, no such increase had occurred  because d’ambrosio  had depleted all of hereford’s 
money.  
52. in november 2024, d’ambrosio sent investor c a text message  stating that the 
nav of investor  c’s investment was “up about 25% ytd ,” which was likewise false.     
53. contrary to d’ambrosio’s false statements to investor c, i n november 2024, 
hereford’s bank account held about $350,  its capital account at hedge fund 3 reflected  a zero 
balance, and it held no other investments .   case 1:25-cv-05884     document 1     filed 07/17/25     page 10 of 15    
 11 iii. d’ambrosio’s misappropriation 
54. d’ambrosio transferred a total of approximately $5.5 million of hereford money 
to himself.   
55. beginning in 2011, d’ambrosio recorded the amounts he had withdr awn from 
hereford as a “loan receivable,” updating the running tally at the end of each year through 2021,  
as follows:    
year  loan receivable  
2011  $3,480,725  
2012  $4,004,725  
2013  $4,559,943  
2014  $4,883,443  
2015  $5,175,943  
2016  $5,260,943  
2017  $5,294,943  
2018  $5,328,943  
2019  $5,362,943  
2020  $5,396,943  
20212 $5,430,943  
 
56. d’ambrosio spent the money that he withdrew from hereford  in various 
unauthorized ways, including to pay his personal expenses.   
57. d’ambrosio thus used hereford money to pay for, among other things,  his 
mortgage, real estate taxes, food, cars, and travel.   
58. between march 2015 and december 2024, d’ambrosio misappropriated 
approximately $390,000 from the hereford investors , not including those who were members of 
his immediate family . 
 
2 after 2021, d’ambrosio stopped recording on a spreadsheet t he a mounts that he misappropria ted  from hereford . case 1:25-cv-05884     document 1     filed 07/17/25     page 11 of 15
    
 12 59. in late 2024, hereford received approximately $2 million in redemption requests  
from various of its investors . 
60. hereford lacked  sufficient funds to fulfill the  late 2024 investor redemption 
requests  because , by that time , d’ambrosio had misappropriated all hereford investor money for 
his personal use. 
61. on or about december 23, 2024, d’ambrosio self -reported his fraudulent scheme 
to law enforcement  personnel , including the commission  staff, and he has since  cooperated with 
the commission staff in  its investigation of  his misconduct . 
62. on or about  december 26, 2024, d’ambrosio informed hereford’s investors by 
email that hereford was unable to “process any redemption or withdrawal request” and was 
“working collaboratively with relevant authorities.”  
63. as of december 31, 2024, the only remaining hereford asset was $325 in a bank 
account (which  charges a $25 monthly  maintenance fee).  
v. tolling agreements  
64. on march 13, 2025, d’ambrosio entered into a tolling agreement, which tolled 
the statute of limitations from march 13, 2025 through september 13, 2025.  the tolling 
agreement specified a period of time in which “the running of any statute of limitations 
application to any action or proceeding against d’ambrosio authorized, instituted, or brought by 
or on behalf of the commission or to which the commission is a party arising out of the 
[commission’s investigation of d’ambrosio’s conduct], including any sanctions or relief that 
may be imposed therein, i s tolled and suspended.”  the tolling agreement further provides that 
d’ambrosio and any of his agents or attorneys “ shall not include the tolling period in the 
calculation of the running of any statute of limitations or for any other time -related defense case 1:25-cv-05884     document 1     filed 07/17/25     page 12 of 15    
 13 applicable to any proceeding, including any sanctions or relief that may be imposed therein, in 
asserting or relying upon any such time -related defense.”  
first  claim for relief

65. the commission re -alleges and incorporates by reference here the allegations in 
paragraphs 1 through 64.

 14 71. d’ambrosio knowingly, recklessly, or negligently (i) made one or more untrue

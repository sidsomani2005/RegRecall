complaint 
the securities and exchange commission (“ sec ”) files this complaint against benjamin 
ballout (“ ballout ”), mohamed zayed (“ zayed ”), and william fielding (“ fielding ”) (collectively, 
“defendants ”), and alleges as follows: 
i. summary  
1. defendants engaged in a fraudulent scheme to pump and dump the publicly traded 
stock of enerkon solar international, inc. (“ enerkon ”). as the sole officer and controlling 
shareholder of enerkon, ballout schemed to inflate enerkon’s stoc k price primarily through false 
and misleading statements and omissi ons in its public statements and disclosures to investors. with 
the help of ballout, fielding and zayed then pr ofited from the scheme through the conversion of 
a bogus promissory note into enerkon stock, which they sold to a third party at inflated prices.     
2. ballout acquired a controlling interest in  enerkon in or around february 2018, and 
thereafter became enerkon’s sole officer. enerkon was a penny-stock company that had no 
employees (aside from ballout) or legitimate business operations. ba llout made a series of false case 9:24-cv-81170-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 09/23/2024   page 1 of 22 2 
 and misleading statements and o missions to pump enerkon’s stock price, including misstatements 
and omissions about enerkon’s supposed busine ss opportunities, assets, and liabilities.    
3. for example, in 2021, ballout authored a nd issued three pre ss releases falsely 
claiming that enerkon: (1) acquired a company with distribution right s to a covid-19 instant test, 
(2) received a $28 million order for the tests, and (3) purchased 122 acres in pennsylvania to build 
a power plant.  zayed, who had a longstanding relations hip with ballout, fabricated a bogus 
purchase order purporting to evidence the $28 million order. on june 22, 2021, based on these 
press releases and questions concerning the accuracy of other public statements or disclosures that 
enerkon made to investors, the sec temporaril y suspended trading in enerkon’s securities. 
4. prior to the trading suspen sion, fielding and zayed coordinated with ballout to 
capitalize on the inflated price of enerkon’s stock. they did so through a convertib le promissory 
note that enerkon issued to fielding as purpor ted consideration for a $180,000 loan. in reality, 
fielding never made a $180,000 loan to enerkon, a nd the note was backdated to november 2017 
and signed by ballout, even though he had no affi liation with enerkon in november 2017. in 
march 2021, enerkon’s transfer agent received an em ail from fielding’s email account, instructing 
the transfer agent to convert th e bogus promissory note into en erkon stock. the email attached a 
fabricated fielding bank account statement and other false record s, purporting to evidence his 
alleged $180,000 loan. relying on these false document s, the transfer agent issued enerkon stock 
to fielding as instructed. in tr ansactions coordinated and negotia ted on his behalf by zayed and 
ballout, fielding then sold a portion of his ener kon shares to a third- party investor for $407,000. 
fielding later paid $96,000 of the trad ing profits to zayed for his role in the fraudulent scheme.      
5. by engaging in the acts and conduct a lleged herein, defendants violated the 
antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. in the interest  of protecting the public from case 9:24-cv-81170-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 09/23/2024   page 2 of 22 3 
 further violations and enforcing the federal securities laws, the sec brings this action seeking 
permanent injunctive relief, dis gorgement of ill-gotten gains pl us prejudgment interest, civil 
penalties, and all other equitable and ancillar y relief the court deem s necessary and proper.

10. defendant zayed is a citizen and resident  of egypt. in 1997, za yed was indicted by 
a federal grand jury for wire fraud, scheme to defraud, and mone y laundering, and a warrant was 
issued for his arrest. see united states v. zayed , no. 1:97-cr-0039 (e.d. tenn.). in 1998, the sec 
sued zayed for securities fraud in connection with  the promotion and sale of the stock of genesis 
international financial services, inc., alleging that he used fra udulent financial statements and 
press releases to deceive  prospective investors. see sec v. zayed , no. 1:98-cv-327 (e.d. tenn.); 
sec lit. release no. 15907 (sept. 24, 1998). the se c was not able to serve zayed with that 
lawsuit and subsequently dismissed its cl aims against zayed without prejudice.  
11. defendant fielding is a resident of delr ay beach, florida. he was formerly the 
registered agent of enerkon, includi ng during at least part of the rele vant events discussed herein.  
iv. related entity  
12. enerkon was a nevada corporation with it s principal place of  business in new 
york, new york. its comm on stock was quoted and tr aded on over-the-counter (“ otc ”) markets

pursuant to the pink basic disclosure guidelines  through a publicly availa ble website maintained 
by otc markets group, inc. on june 22, 2021, the sec suspended tr ading in enerkon’s securities 
pursuant to section 12(k) of the securities act.  on or about october 6, 2022, enerkon was sold to 
new investors who subsequently rename d it and put in new management.  case 9:24-cv-81170-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 09/23/2024   page 4 of 22 5 
 v. facts 
a. defendants and enerkon  
13. ballout became enerkon’s pr esident, ceo, and cfo in or around february 8, 2018, 
after acquiring a controlling interest  in the company from its prior owner, and he remained its sole 
officer until approximately october 6, 2022. between february 2018 and october 2022, ballout drafted enerkon’s press releases and had sole authority to appr ove them. he also drafted and 
approved all of enerkon’s otc disclosures, otc financial reports, and other public filings.  
14. fielding and zayed have a longstanding business rela tionship through a company 
that they jointly own that focuses on defense/s ecurity in the middle east. through that work and 
before ballout acquired a controlling interest in enerkon, fielding and zayed met and developed 
a relationship with ballout, who was also working in the defense/security industry at the time.  
15. subsequently, fielding and zayed became involved in enerkon, with zayed acting 
in an unofficial role and fielding serving as its registered agent. fielding also purported to be 
enerkon’s lender and shareholder th rough a bogus promissory note that he converted to shares of 
enerkon, as further discussed below.  
16. informally, fielding let ball out and zayed use his credit cards to pay miscellaneous 
expenses for enerkon, including en erkon expenses relating to otc administrative fees, publishing 
press releases, domain hosting fees , and other similar charges. thes e charges were typically in the 
range of $2,000–$3,000 per month, and were commingled with charges that fielding, ballout, or zayed made on the same credit cards for expenses  unrelated to enerkon. fiel ding testified that he 
was reimbursed for some of these monthly charge s relating to enerkon, but not all. it does not 
appear that enerkon contemporaneously or formally : (i) accounted in its books and records for the 
expenses that were paid for with fielding’s credit cards; or (ii) disclosed these expenses in its otc 
disclosures, otc financial statemen ts, or other public disclosures.  case 9:24-cv-81170-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 09/23/2024   page 5 of 22 6 
 b. ballout made a series of false and misleadi ng statements and omissions to investors 
in furtherance of his scheme to inflate enerkon’s stock price.  
17. shortly after acquiring a c ontrolling interest  in enerkon in february 2018 and 
continuing until the sec suspended trading in enerkon’s securities on june 22, 2021, ballout knowingly or severely recklessly engaged in a sc heme to inflate the price of enerkon’s publicly 
traded stock. he sought to a ccomplish this scheme primarily  through false and misleading 
statements and omissions in ener kon’s press releases and public fi lings—all of which he authored 
and approved as the sole office r of enerkon. these false and misl eading statements and omissions 
created false and misleading impressions about en erkon’s supposed busine ss opportunities, assets, 
and liabilities.  
i. ballout’s scheme to pump enerkon’s stock price  
 
18. as the controlling shareholder in enerkon, ballout had a strong financial 
motivation to pump enerkon’s stoc k price. during the course of his scheme, ballout owned 33 
million shares of enerkon stock, mo re than 50% of its outstanding stock. by increasing the value 
of enerkon stock, he stood to make  a significant profit th rough the eventual sale of his shares.  
19. however, enerkon was not engaged in a ny known profit-generating business. at 
all relevant times, enerkon’s bank account ha d less than $100. and following ballout’s acquisition 
of enerkon, he relied on fielding’s  personal credit card to help f und enerkon’s operating expenses.  
20. rather than work to improve enerkon’s business or to enha nce its underlying 
financial value, ballout develope d and implemented a scheme to artificially inflate the price of 
enerkon’s stock. to that end, by at least early 2 021, ballout touted plans to increase enerkon’s 
stock price above $4.00 per share to  qualify for listing on the nasd aq stock exchange. in a march 
2021 press release, for example, ballout cited the company’s continued plans to qualify for trading 
on nasdaq. in another press release dated may 20, 2021, ballout again cited enerkon’s “up list case 9:24-cv-81170-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 09/23/2024   page 6 of 22 7 
 plans to the nasdaq market which maintains a minimum share entry price of $4.00 to qualify 
for listing on the national exchange.”  
21. ballout’s scheme, however, was foiled when the sec suspended trading in 
enerkon’s securities on june 22, 202 1. according to the sec’s pres s release dated june 22, 2021, 
the temporary suspension was “due to, among other things, lack of adequate and accurate information in enerkon’s quarterly  and annual financials ” and questions regard ing “the accuracy 
and adequacy of publicly disseminated informati on in press releases,” including the three press 
releases discussed further below. before the sec suspended trading, ballout knowingly or 
severely recklessly made materially false statem ents and omissions and engaged in deceptive acts 
in furtherance of his scheme, including but not limited to the examples discussed below.  
ii. ballout made false and misleading statem ents and omissions in enerkon’s press 
releases concerning supposed business opportunities arising from a covid-19 test device. 
 
22. on march 9, 2021, enerkon issued a press release, which ballout authored and 
approved. the press release touted enerkon’s purporte d partial acquisition of  a u.k. corporation 
based in london, england (the “ agent ”). it also discussed a covi d-19 test device manufactured 
by a canadian company (the “ manufacturer ”), and for which another canadian company held 
exclusive distribu tion rights (the “ distributor ”). in relevant part, the press release stated:    
we are pleased to announce that we have  completed the initial acquisition of 
[agent] whereby a 40% stake was acquired and an additional 60% is expected to 
be acquired additionally in the coming week . . . [agent ] owns distribution rights 
to a new covid-19 test device, produced by [manufacturer] and [distributor], 
which is a rapid (15 seconds) test device . . .     23. in reality, the agent did not own distribut ion rights to the covid-19 test device 
referenced in the march 9, 2021 pre ss release. in late 2020, agent entered a sales-representative 
agreement with the distributor, the master distributor of products  manufactured by the case 9:24-cv-81170-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 09/23/2024   page 7 of 22 8 
 manufacturer. but that agreement did not give ag ent any distribution righ ts to those products. a 
subsequent memorandum of u nderstanding dated january 24, 2021, between distributor and 
agent also made clear that agent did not own distribution rights.  
24. distributor’s executives also expressly in formed ballout and za yed that agent did 
not own any distribution rights to the covid-19 test. upon lear ning of the march 9, 2021 press 
release, a distributor executive sent an ema il on or around march 17, 2021 to ballout, copying 
zayed, expressly informing him:  
unfortunately, the information you are sendi ng out in the public to raise funds and 
awareness is completely fals e. we have entertained di scussions with [agent] to 
eventually become a sub-distributor of [dis tributor] for the sale  and distribution of 
various products and services for which we hold the rights th rough proper and legal 
contracts with the patent hol der [manufacturer]. to date no firm contract has been 
finalized or even less signed. your webs ite is advertising false and misleading 
information. [agent] does not own the di stribution rights to the [covid-19] insta-
test and does not have any formal rights wh atsoever at this time. because of this i 
insist you remove all menti on of [distributor] and refe rence covid [sic] testing 
referring to our companies.   25. ballout knew, or was severe ly reckless in not knowing, that the statement in the 
march 9, 2021 press release that  “[agent] owns distribution rights to a new covid-19 test 
device, produced by [a canadian manufacturer] and [dis tributor]” was false or misleading at the 
time it was made. also, based on the email th e march 17, 2021 email from the distributor 
executive, ballout knew or was severely reckless in  not knowing that this statement in the march 
9, 2021 press release was false or misleading at th e time it was made. yet, ballout never disclosed 
any of the facts in the march 17, 2021 email quoted  above, and never disclosed the fact that the 
distributor contacted enerkon de manding that it take down the fa lse and misleading statements 
about agent’s supposed distribution rights.  case 9:24-cv-81170-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 09/23/2024   page 8 of 22 9 
 26. on may 11, 2021, enerkon issued another pr ess release—which ballout authored 
and approved—that contained fa lse and misleading statements and omissions concerning a 
fabricated order for the covid-19 test.  
27. in relevant part, the may 11, 2021 press re lease stated that enerkon “announce[d] 
today its first contingent order for the sars2 covid19 15 second ‘insta test’ as produced by 
[manufacturer] with co sales via [distribut or] and [agent] (an [enerkon] wholly owned 
division).” the release quoted ba llout as saying that the “‘orde r was placed by an ngo operating 
in the dominican republic from a major medi cal foundation’” and was valued at “‘$28,000,000 
per month’” or “‘$320 million annually.’” the rel ease further quoted ballout as saying that the 
order was “‘a great start for the new company ac quisition of [agent] and its co sales partner 
[distributor] in canada, the main di stributor with [ma nufacturer].’”   
28. as an initial matter, th e may 11, 2021 press release was false or misleading, 
because ballout knowingly or severely recklessly  failed to disclose the facts discussed in 
paragraphs 22-25 above, including th at agent lacked distribution ri ghts to the covid 19 test, that 
distributor sent him the marc h 17, 2021 email describe d in paragraph 24 a bove, or any of the 
material facts stated in th at march 17, 2021 email.   
29. further, the may 11, 2021 press release wa s false, because there was no multi-
million-dollar order for the covid-19  test or, for that matter, any order at all.  on april 14, 2021, 
zayed received an email at his email address fro m an email address associated with a purported 
non-governmental organization operating in the dominican republic (the “ ngo ”). the email 
attached a letter of interest (“ loi”), dated april 15, 2021, purportedl y from the director of the 
ngo. the loi contained a purchase order for covid-19 tests matching the description in 
enerkon’s may 11, 2021 press release.  case 9:24-cv-81170-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 09/23/2024   page 9 of 22 10 
 30. the loi showed that it had been copied to zayed and li sted a website purportedly 
associated with the ngo. records from the webs ite’s domain hosts, however, show that this 
website has not been linked to any entity cal led by the given name of the ngo. instead, these 
records list zayed and fielding as the contacts for the ngo website and show fielding’s credit 
card as the payment method. therefor e, the reasonable inference is that zayed fabricated the loi 
and purchase order, then sent an  email from the ngo email address (t hat he controlled) to himself 
with the fake loi and purchase order on april 14, 2021. zayed then forwarded the email and loi 
he purportedly received from the ngo to the distributor.  
31. after receiving the fake loi, the distributor never accepted the supposed order 
referenced in the press release. because distributo r never accepted the orde r, the order could never 
generate any revenue even if it wa s legitimate (which it was not).  
32. ballout authored and authorized the pres s release, which referenced the fake 
purchase order that he had no way of knowing about  other than through zayed, with whom he had 
a longstanding relationship that pre-dated enerkon. ballout also had access and authority to use 
fielding’s credit card that was used to pay for the website associated with the ngo. ballout knew 
or was severely reckless in not knowing that the loi/purchase order was not  legitimate, that the 
distributor did not accept the lo i/purchase order, and that the loi/purchase order could not 
generate any revenue for agent. yet, neither ball out nor enerkon disclosed these material facts in 
the may 11, 2021 press release or any subse quent press release or public filings.  
iii. ballout made false and misleading statem ents and omissions in an enerkon press 
release concerning a power plant that enerkon allegedly planned to build.  
 
33. on may 3, 2021, enerkon issued a press release—which ballout authored and 
approved—quoting ballout as stat ing, “[t]oday, [enerkon] is pleased to announce the signed 
agreement to purchase of 122 acres [sic] of comm ercial land in pennsylvania turnpike area for case 9:24-cv-81170-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 09/23/2024   page 10 of 22 11 
 the establishment of our planned 20 mw solar a nd hydrogen plant facility.” this press release 
was false and misleading.   
34. the “commercial land” referenced in the press release was actually zoned 
residential, not commercial. according to the zoning office r for penn forest township, 
pennsylvania, where the land was located, the to wnship never received any correspondence, re-
zoning applications, or other documents from enerkon relating to any plan to  build an energy plant 
there. enerkon also l acked the funds to build  a 20 mw solar and hydroge n plant. in addition, 
enerkon never paid the landowner anyt hing, according to the landowner.  
35. the may 3, 2021 press release also incl uded a picture purporting to depict 
enerkon’s future solar and hydrogen plant. as presented and captione d, the picture gives the false 
and misleading impression of an act ual plant that enerkon had plans to  build. in reality, the picture 
in the press release depicts a pl ant located in japan that is one  of the world’s largest hydrogen-
producing facilities—a fact that is not disclosed in the press re lease or any of enerkon’s other 
public filings.  
36. ballout knew or was severely reckless in  not knowing that the may 3, 2021 press 
release contained the false and misleading statem ents described in paragraphs 33-35 above. he 
also knowingly or severely recklessl y failed to disclose the material  facts described in paragraphs 
33-35 above in the may 3, 2021 press release or any other public fili ng or statement.  
iv. statements concerning enerkon’s financial condition 
 
37. ballout caused enerkon to report on its ba lance sheet in its otc disclosures and 
financial statements that enerkon had millions in  “cash.” for example, enerkon’s balance sheet 
included in its june 30, 2018 otc disclosure re ported more than $65 million in “cash.”  case 9:24-cv-81170-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 09/23/2024   page 11 of 22 12 
 38. at the time of these statements and di sclosures, enerkon never had more than $100 
cash in its bank account. ballout te stified that the cash balance de scribed above was deferred (or 
unearned) revenue. but enerkon’s fi nancial statements and otc disc losures did not disclose that 
the reported cash balance described above  was either deferred or unearned.  
39. as further discussed below, fielding purportedly made a $180 ,000 loan to enerkon 
pursuant to a convertible promissory note date d and signed by ballout, on behalf of enerkon, on 
november 30, 2017. in 2021, fielding converted the note to enerkon stock, which he sold for a 
profit of at least $407,000. however, certain of enerkon’s otc disclosures and financial 
statements after the note was purportedly signe d by ballout in november 2017 do not disclose 
fielding’s purported $180,000 loan or his conver tible promissory note. for example, enerkon’s 
december 31, 2018 otc disclosure and its ju ne 30, 2019 quarterly otc disclosure—both of 
which ballout signed and approved—do not disclose  the loan or note. in  enerkon’s september 30, 
2019 quarterly otc disclosure—which ballo ut signed and approved—enerkon publicly 
disclosed the purported loan and note.   
40. ballout’s false and misleading statements  and omissions were material. they 
created false and misleading impressions abou t enerkon’s financial condition and lucrative 
business opportunities that di d not actually exist.  
41. zayed knowingly or severely recklessly enga ged in one or more deceptive acts in 
furtherance of ballout’s scheme to artificially inflate the price of enerkon’s stock. for example, 
zayed knew, or was severely reckless in not know ing, that at least the march 9, 2021 and may 11, 
2021 press releases were false a nd misleading. on march 17, 2021, a distributor  executive copied 
zayed on the email to ballout referenced in pa ragraph 24 above stating that agent did not own 
any distribution rights to the covid-19 test, as represented in the march 9, 2021 release. case 9:24-cv-81170-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 09/23/2024   page 12 of 22 13 
 subsequently, as discussed in paragraphs 29-32 above, zayed created a website for a fictitious 
ngo in the dominican republic, fabricated a bogus loi, and emailed the bogus loi to the 
distributor in connection with the alleged purchase order tout ed in the may 11, 2021 release. 
42. ballout’s fraudulent scheme, and false a nd misleading statements and omissions, 
artificially inflated the pric e of enerkon’s stock. for example,  on march 8, 2021, enerkon’s stock 
price closed at $0.87 per share; after the issuance of the false and misleading press release on 
march 9, 2021, enerkon’s stock price closed at $0.93 per share, an increase of roughly 6.9%. 
investors bought or sold enerkon securities during the course of  ballout’s fraudulent scheme, 
misstatements, and omissions, and suffere d pecuniary harm as a result.   
c. defendants schemed to convert a bogus prom issory note issued to fielding into 
shares of enerkon and sell those shares at inflated prices.  
43. between at least may 2019 and june 2021, in  coordination with ballout’s scheme 
to pump enerkon’s stock price, defendants engage d in a fraudulent scheme  to: (1) create a bogus 
promissory note purportedly issued by enerkon to fielding, (2) convert that bogus note to shares 
of enerkon stock, and (3) sell those shares to a third party at inflated prices.  
44. the bogus note was purportedly issued as  consideration for a $180,000 loan that 
fielding allegedly made to enerkon on or before  november 30, 2017. the note, which identifies 
fielding as the creditor and ener kon as the debtor, was purportedly si gned by ballout on behalf of 
enerkon on november 30, 2017. the not e provided that enerkon was obl igated to repay fielding 
the principal sum of $180,000 on or before n ovember 30, 2018. should enerkon fail to timely 
repay fielding in full, th e note gave fielding the right to convert the note to a designated number 
of shares of enerkon stock. 
45. however, the note was created in furthera nce of the fraudulent scheme. fielding 
did not loan enerkon $180,000 on or before novemb er 30, 2017 or at any other time. the note case 9:24-cv-81170-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 09/23/2024   page 13 of 22 14 
 was also backdated. it appears that the note was actually created and signed on or about may 9, 
2019, when fielding received an email from an “e nerkon international” em ail address attaching 
the “final signed” promissory note. ballout  purportedly signed th e note as enerkon’s 
“chairman” on november 30, 2017, but  in fact, he did not become  affiliated with enerkon until 
february 2018—more than two months after the da te he purportedly signed the note. also, in 
enerkon’s september 30, 2019 quar terly otc disclosure, enerkon publicly disclosed the 
purported loan and note. but enerkon’s otc di sclosures prior to september 30, 2019 do not 
disclose or mention the purported note and loan. that includes, for example, enerkon’s december 
31, 2018 otc disclosure and its june 30, 2019 qu arterly otc disclosure, neither of which 
disclosed the purported loan and note.   
46. fielding subsequently took steps to conve rt the bogus note into  shares of enerkon 
stock. on march 20, 2021, enerkon’s transfer agent r eceived documents relating to the conversion 
of fielding’s bogus promissory note from fieldi ng’s email account. attached  to that email were 
documents purporting to be evidence of the alleged $180,000 loan to enerkon, including (a) an 
invoice enerkon purportedly issued to fieldi ng for three payments totaling $180,000, and 
(b) fielding’s purported bank account statement, which listed three payments to enerkon in 
october 2017 totaling $180,000, consistent with the enerkon invoice. howeve r, fielding’s bank 
statement was fabricated. his actua l bank statement from this period does not reflect these three 
payments. in truth, fielding never paid $180,000 to  or on behalf of enerkon in or around october 
2017, and the statement that was sent to enerkon’s  transfer agent from fi elding’s email account 
supporting his request to  obtain enerkon shares  was fabricated.  
47. in the march 20, 2021 email to  enerkon’s transfer agen t from fielding’s email 
account, a debt conversion notice an d seller’s representation letter we re attached, both of which case 9:24-cv-81170-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 09/23/2024   page 14 of 22 15 
 fielding signed. the debt conversion notice falsel y represented that the bogus promissory note 
was entered into in november 2017. the seller’s representation le tter falsely represented that 
the note was entered into in november 2017 and th at fielding’s shares were acquired through a 
loan to enerkon that, in fact, he never made.  
48. ballout acted knowingly or with severe recklessness in furtherance of the bogus 
note scheme. for example, ballout executed the b ogus promissory note as chairman of enerkon, 
even though the note was backdated and, as of th e purported date of th e note (november 30, 2017), 
he had no affiliation with enerkon or authority to  issue a promissory note on enerkon’s behalf. on 
or around march 20, 2021, ballout em ailed enerkon’s transf er agent and atta ched a march 19, 
2021 “issuance resolution” (which he signed as “c eo” of enerkon) falsely representing that the 
promissory note was issued to fielding on november 30, 2017.  
49. on or around may 11, 2021, ba llout emailed enerkon’s tran sfer agent and wrote in 
the subject line: “final conversi on of note for fielding documents attached as per his request and 
our permission.” ballout attached to that email to  the transfer agent, among other things, the bogus 
note as well as an enerkon board resolution and debt conversion notice, both of which were 
dated may 9, 2021, signed by ballout, and falsely represented that on november 30, 2017 the 
bogus note was issued to fielding and that  enerkon incurred the underlying debt.  
50. likewise, zayed acted knowingl y or with severe recklessn ess, in coordination with 
fielding and ballout, in furthe rance of defendants’ bogus pro missory note scheme. fielding 
testified that he believed zayed prepared at least some of the documents that fielding sent to 
enerkon’s transfer agent in connection with the conversion of the bogus promissory note. 
similarly, emails between zayed and fielding furt her indicate that zaye d prepared—or directed 
lawyers or other professionals to prepare—ot her documents in connection with fielding’s case 9:24-cv-81170-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 09/23/2024   page 15 of 22 16 
 conversion of the bogus promissory  note and sales of enerkon shar es, including but not limited to 
legal opinions, affidavits, letter s, and agreements. zayed sent t hose documents to fielding for his 
review, approval, and, when necessary, his signature.  
51. as a further example of zayed’s involv ement, zayed emailed fielding on or around 
january 10, 2021 to provide fielding with a status report on the conve rsion of the bogus  promissory 
note to enerkon shares. zayed listed  a number of steps that were ei ther planned or completed to 
effectuate the conversio n, including the issuance of an en erkon “corporate reso lution last year 
dated to comply with the holding period” and docume nts that needed to be prepared and sent to 
the transfer agent. he also advised fielding ab out the timing of when they should try to sell 
fielding’s enerkon shares to maxi mize their return. following this upda te and list of next steps, 
zayed told fielding that once they finished thei r current set of transactions, then “we will get 
more free shares from ben [ballout] th en after that and do it again .…”  
52. as a result of the documents sent to enerkon’s transfer agent discussed in 
paragraphs 46-49 above, fielding successfully c onverted the bogus promissory note to at least 
9,000,000 unrestricted shares of enerkon stock.   
53. ballout and zayed then negotiated the sale  of fielding’s stock with a third-party 
investor who purchased the shar es.  for example, on february 24, 2021, ballout emailed the third-
party investor, thanking the investor  for the offer to fiel ding, but noting that he  “would be insulting 
him [fielding]” if he shared it with fiel ding. on march 5, 2021, zayed—holding himself out as 
an advisor to fielding and enerkon —emailed the third-party invest or and conveyed that fielding 
wanted to wait to sell his enerkon stock until th ere were “better market conditions.” just days 
later—on march 9, 2021— enerkon issued the pre ss release announcing the distribution rights 
purportedly owned by agent, discus sed in paragraphs 22-25 above. case 9:24-cv-81170-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 09/23/2024   page 16 of 22 17 
 54. weeks later, between may 19, 2021 and may 27, 2021, fielding sold his enerkon 
shares to that same third-party investor at prices inflated by the false and misleading statements 
and omissions discussed in paragraphs 17- 42 above, receiving a to tal profit of $407,000.  
55. before the sale, fielding agreed to provi de zayed a share of the sales proceeds. 
true to his word, fielding sent zayed $96,000 from the sales proceeds following the sale. 
56. fielding also entered into an agreement w ith a third-party invest or on or about june 
7, 2021 to sell additional enerkon shares for $569,000, but it does not appear that he received 
payment pursuant to this agreement.

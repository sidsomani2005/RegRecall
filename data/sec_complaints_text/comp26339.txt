complaint  
plaintiff united states securities and exchange commission (“sec”) alleges:  
1. from at least february 2019 through at least july 2023 (“relevant period”), 
defendant eliseo jojo prisno and defendant p/e capital investment management 
partners (“p/e capital”), an investment adviser he controlled (together, the 
“defendants”), violated the federal securities laws by charging many  of their advisory 
clients inflated, unauthorized, and unearned fees.  
2. defendants oftentimes did so by signing in to their clients’ brokerage 
accounts using their clients’ login credentials —frequently without their clients’ 
knowledge or consent —and then routing multifactor authentication texts to phone 
numbers under defendants’ control. through this scheme and other deception, they 
cumulatively charged over 220 advisory client accounts approximately $2.4 million in case: 1:25-cv-07491 document #: 1 filed: 07/03/25 page 1 of 14 pageid #:1 2 unauthorized and undisclosed quarterly fees —on top of the disclosed annual advisory 
fees. prisno was personally enriched by charging these fees.  
3. by engaging in this conduct, defendants violated sections 206(1) and 
206(2) of the investment advisers act of 1940 (“advisers act”) [15 u.s.c. §§  80b-6(1) 
and 80b-6(2)]. defendants will continue to violate the federal securities laws unless 
restrained or enjoined by this court. the sec therefore seeks a judgment against 
defendants that includ es: (a) imposing permanent injunctive relief , including prohibiti ng 
prisno from acting as or being associated with a broker, dealer, or investment adviser;  (b) ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest; and (c) imposing 
civil monetary penalties. 
jurisdiction and venue  
 
4. this court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to sections 209(d) and 
214(a) of the advisers act [15 u.s.c. §§ 80b- 9(d) and 80b-14(a)].  
5. in connection with the conduct alleged in this complaint, defendants  
directly or indirectly made use of the means or instruments of transportation and 
communication in interstate commerce, or of the mails, or of the facilities of a national 
securities exchange.   
6. venue is proper in this court because a cts, practices, and courses of 
business constituting violations alleged herein have occurred within the jurisdiction of the united states district court for the northern district of illinois. prisno resides in this 
district, and p/e capital’s principal  place of business is in this district. 
 case: 1:25-cv-07491 document #: 1 filed: 07/03/25 page 2 of 14 pageid #:2 3 defendants  
 
7. eliseo jojo prisno, age 58, is a resident of chicago, illinois. prisno and his 
wife are co -owners and managers of p/e capital. prisno is the majority owner, chief 
executive officer, chief compliance officer, and “senior investment advisor” of p/e 
capital. he provides all advisory services on behalf of p/e capital and effectively 
controls the company and its securities investment decisions. at all times during the 
relevant period, prisno was an “investment adviser” as that term is defined in the advisers act.  
8. p/e capital investment management partners is an illinois partnership 
with its principal place of business in chicago, illinois. it  was founded in 2010 and has 
been registered as an investment adviser with the state of illinois since september 2014, 
as well as with california, indiana, and conditionally with texas since 2021. as of july 
2021, p/e capital reported having 150 clients and assets under management of 
approximately $40,500,000. as of january 2025, it report ed having 120 clients and assets 
under management of approximately $20,500,000. at all times during the relevant 
period, p/e capital was an “investment adviser” as that term is defined in the advisers 
act. 
factual allegations  
i. background  
9. defendants provide discretionary investment management services to 
clients, most of whom are of filipino descent and live either in the philippines or the 
united states. many of p/e capital’s clients are not experienced investors.  case: 1:25-cv-07491 document #: 1 filed: 07/03/25 page 3 of 14 pageid #:3 4 10. defendants entered into investment advisory relationships with and owed a 
fiduciary duty to each of its clients. p/e capital collected advisory fees from its clients. it 
charged its clients annual fees based on a percentage of their assets under management 
(“advisory  fee”).  during the relevant period, defendants disclosed the following 
information about fees  in p/e capital’s form adv part 2a brochure (“brochure”), 
which defendants provided to at least some advisory clients:  
(a) p/e capital charged  its clients who had accounts at 
brokerage firms a and b advisory fee s of either 2% or 
2.4%.  
(b) p/e capital did not charge any performance- based fees.  
(c) p/e capital billed  for its services in arrears; it did not 
charge the clients in advance or solicit or require 
prepayment of fees.  
(d) beginning with its brochure filed august 18, 2021, p/e 
capital first disclosed that it would charge accounts at 
brokerage firm a enrolled in its “growth hedge 
(nasdaq 100) mip program” 50% of “realized credit options revenue share ,” defined as  “realized gains 
derived from writing derivatives.”   
11. these were the only fees p/e capital disclose d to defendants’ clients who 
had accounts at brokerage firm a or brokerage firm b.   
12. prisno signed the amendments to p/e capital’s form advs, including the 
amendments to the brochure filed during the relevant period.  
  case: 1:25-cv-07491 document #: 1 filed: 07/03/25 page 4 of 14 pageid #:4 5 ii. defendants charged more than $2.4 million in 
undisclosed and unauthorized fees to clients with 
trading accounts at brokerage firm a.  
13. brokerage firm a permitted p/e capital’s clients to pre-authorize quarterly 
invoicing by p/e capital up to a set, authorized dollar limit (“quarterly fee cap”). 
during the relevant period, defendants used this quarterly fee cap to charge unearned 
and unauthorized quarterly fees—above and beyond the disclosed advisory fees—to many client accounts held at brokerage firm a (“added fees”).  
14. here’s how they did it:  first, defendants would facilitate the client’s 
opening of a brokerage account with brokerage firm a by creating a username, 
password, and account security questions for the client on brokerage firm a’s online 
platform. while some clients changed their passwords, others continued to use the password provided to them by p/e capital. this enabled defendants to access a client’s 
account without her knowledge. the brokerage account opening documents supplied to the client included no reference to any added fees.  
15. second, p/e capital would provide brokerage firm a with the client’s 
purported contact information, which oftentimes included a mobile phone number and an 
email address controlled by defendants, not the client.  
16. third, defendants —oftentimes within 30 days  of the opening of the 
brokerage account— would sign in with p/e capital’s adviser username and password 
(“adviser login”) to request a quarterly fee cap. this request, in turn, would trigger 
brokerage firm a’s request directed to the client for her approval.  
 case: 1:25-cv-07491 document #: 1 filed: 07/03/25 page 5 of 14 pageid #:5 6 17. fourth, defendants would use the client’s login credentials to log into her 
brokerage firm a account portal. defendants would circumvent brokerage firm a’s 
multifactor authentication by routing the authentication code—which the brokerage firm 
intended for the client —to themselves.  
18. fifth, once brokerage firm a’s system authenticated the user, 
defendants —still posing as their client— would then pretend to approve p/e capital’s 
request to establish a quarterly fee cap.   
19. sixth, p/e capital would then sign in as itself —using its adviser login—
and invoice its client for an added fee, which oftentimes amounted to the quarterly fee 
cap. 
20. while the amount of the added fees varied over time and by account, 
during the relevant period the added fees on average amounted to more than twice to 
three times the disclosed advisory fees.  in other words, while p/e capital disclosed 
advisory fees of 2% or 2.4%, it actually charged these clients an average of more than 
7% of assets under management —totaling more than $2.4 million in added fees 
charged to at least 220 client accounts. these added fees were not disclosed to clients in 
p/e capital’s brochure or marketing materials . 
21. many, if not all, of these  clients who were charged added fees did not 
know that p/e capital was charging fees above and beyond the disclosed advisory fee, 
and had not agreed to the added fees, including clients a, b, and c.  
22. client a. when client a invested with p/e capital in 2020, he was not 
aware he would pay any fees other than the advisory fee and did not agree to added case: 1:25-cv-07491 document #: 1 filed: 07/03/25 page 6 of 14 pageid #:6 7 fees. yet d uring the relevant period, defendants charged him over $10,000 in added 
fees—tripling the total fees he paid p/e capital.   
23. client b. on or around september 24, 2019, p/e capital used its adviser 
login to request added fees from a brokerage firm a account held by p/e capital 
client b. client b never authorized p/e capital to charge any fees other than advisory 
fees. but two days later someone logged into client b’s account,  from the same ip 
address as the person at p/e capital who used the adviser login to request the added 
fees, and approved the request. client b never so much as saw —let alone approved—the 
fee request.  
24. client c. client c opened an account at brokerage firm a in october 
2020, with only the 2.4% advisory fee listed in the account application. prisno’s phone 
number was set for multi-factor authentication. a quarterly fee cap was later added  in 
march 2021 and then raised in november 2021. the “client approval” for these quarterly 
fee caps did not come from client c. rather, the adviser login request and purported 
client login approval both came from ip addresses that had been used to approve added 
fees in many other  accounts.  
25. in all, for at least 167 quarterly fee cap changes, both the fee request from 
the adviser login and the purported fee approval from the client login originated from 
the same ip address.  
26. after charging their clients the added fees for more than four years, 
defendants misconduct stopped when, in or around august 2023, brokerage firm a 
notified defendants that it would close p/e capital’s advisory account. case: 1:25-cv-07491 document #: 1 filed: 07/03/25 page 7 of 14 pageid #:7 8 iii. defendants charged undisclosed and unauthorized 
fees to clients with trading accounts at brokerage 
firm b.  
27. p/e capital disclosed that clients’ accounts held at brokerage firm b 
would be charged an a dvisory fee (2% before july 15, 2021 and 2.4% after july 15, 
2021), which was supposed to be paid from the accounts in six annual increments, every 
60 days.  
28. p/e capital was responsible for calculating the advisory fees to be deducted 
from the account by  brokerage firm b.  
29. p/e capital overcharged many of its brokerage firm b clients. during the 
relevant period, p/e capital charged many client accounts at brokerage firm b with fees 
inconsistent with and higher than the disclosed and agreed -upon advisory fee.  
30. numerous accounts were also billed at a frequency other than the disclosed 
frequency of once every 60 days.  
iv. defendants’ ill- gotten gains  
31. of the more than $3.3 million in fees p/e capital received from its clients 
during the relevant period, more than $2.4 million came from added  fees  charged to 
clients’ accounts held at brokerage firm a, and more than $100,000 came from 
overbilling advisory fees to clients’ accounts held at brokerage firm b.  
32. in the relevant period, prisno transferred at least $2.9 million from p/e 
capital to prisno’s personal checking account, through which he paid for personal 
expenses.  case: 1:25-cv-07491 document #: 1 filed: 07/03/25 page 8 of 14 pageid #:8 9 v. defendants breached their fiduciary duties  
to their clients. 
33. defendants are investment advisers. as such, they owe each client 
affirmative duties of utmost good faith, care, loyalty, full and fair disclosure of all 
material facts, and to act in the client’s best interests.  
34. by engaging in the conduct described above, defendants breached their 
duties to their clients, including by charging undisclosed, unauthorized, and unearned 
fees in amounts without any basis, and by deceptively accessing client accounts through 
client logins and bypassing multifactor authentication to approve such fees.  
35. defendants’ misrepresentations and omissions regarding the added fees 
were material. in making a decision to use defendants as an investment adviser that made 
investment decisions on their behalf, a reasonable investor would have considered  it 
important that—rather than charging the fees disclosed and represented to clients—
defendants instead charged  undisclosed, unauthorized, and unearned fees to client 
accounts, in many cases without client authorization.  
36. defendants acted with scienter. at the time defendants charged their 
advisory clients inflated, unauthorized, undisclosed, and unearned fees, defendants knew 
or recklessly disregarded that their representations to prospective advisory clients 
regarding the fees charged to clients’ accounts were false, misleading, and omitted 
material information. defendants knew, or recklessly disregarded, that they received, and 
were continuing to receive, millions of dollars of manually invoiced quarterly fees, on top 
of the disclosed annual advisory fees. defendants acted with scienter, recklessly, or case: 1:25-cv-07491 document #: 1 filed: 07/03/25 page 9 of 14 pageid #:9 10 negligently by failing to ensure that they only charged their clients the fees they had 
disclosed to their clients. 
vi. prisno’s continuing misconduct  
37. in 2022, defendants began undertaking to transition at least some of their 
p/e capital clients to other platforms, including ashtree block ventures llc 
(“ashtree”), another investment adviser that prisno controlled.  
38. between about september 2022 and march 2024, prisno registered ashtree 
with the sec as an “internet adviser” because he hoped the sec’s imprimatur would 
attract and retain investors and clients. prisno filed a form adv for ashtree claiming it 
had $5 million in assets under management and 94 clients . prisno did so despite knowing 
that ashtree was not operational, had zero clients, and zero assets under management. even after sec staff told prisno that ashtree was not eligible to register as an “internet 
adviser,” prisno did not immediately withdraw ashtree’s registration. only after sec 
staff told prisno that it would be withdrawing ashtree’s registration did he do so on his 
own initiative.  
vii. this action is timely filed.   
39. the misconduct at issue in this complaint occurred between about february 
2019 and at least july 2023.  
40. defendants entered into agreements with the sec in which they agreed to toll 
any statute of limitations applicable to the conduct and claims alleged herein between march 20, 2024 and august 17, 2025 .

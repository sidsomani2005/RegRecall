summary 
4. from no later than december 2020 th rough at least january 2022, 
mausner—a recidivist who previously had a sec cease-and-desist order and 
industry/associational bar issued against him due to securities law violations—and 
evolution lending, llc, an entity th at mausner contro lled (“evolution”) 
(collectively, “defendants”),  defrauded investors in conn ection with an unregistered 
offering of limited partnership interests in  a pooled investment vehicle that they 
called the cryptocurrency grow th fund l.p. (the “fund”).  in total, mausner and 
evolution raised approxima tely $413,000 from at least 11 investors across multiple 
states.   
5. defendants sold interests in the fund through false and misleading 
statements and omissions regarding mausne r’s disciplinary history and crypto asset-
related investments.  for ex ample, they informed investors that mausner was the 
principal of evolution and ha d “30 years of experience in the financial advisory and 
money management industry,” but conveniently failed to mention that the sec had 
previously barred him from the securities industr y.  further, they told investors that 
the fund would invest in crypto assets and hold them at specific crypto asset trading 
platforms; however, defenda nts never held any fund -related assets on those 
platforms.   case 3:25-cv-01591-btm-vet     document 1     filed 06/23/25     pageid.2     page 2 of 24

101112131415161718192021222324252627286. in addition to making false and mi sleading representations, defendants 
also deposited the money that investors cont ributed to the fund to evolution’s bank 
accounts and mausner’s personal bank accounts, mixing—or commingling—fund 
assets with completely unrelated  assets in the process.   
7. throughout this period, defendants , each acting as an investment 
adviser under section 202(a)(11) of th e advisers act, 15 u.s.c. §80b-2(a)(11), 
received ill-gotten management and performance fees for services that they promised, 
but never provided.  in so doing, mausne r not only violated the antifraud provisions 
of the securities laws, he also violated the aforementioned industry/associational bar 
by acting as an investment adviser.   
8. in addition to violating the antifraud provisions of the exchange act and 
securities act, defendants’ false and mi sleading statements and commingling of 
investor funds breached their fiduciary du ties to the fund as investment advisers, 
including their duties of
 utmost good faith and full and fair  disclosure of all material 
facts, and their affirmative obligation to employ reasonable care to avoid misleading 
the fund, in violation of the adviser act’s antifraud provisions .   
9. on top of this, defendants never re gistered their fraudulent offering of 
interests in the fund with the sec, a nd no exemptions from the registration 
requirement applied to the offering.  fo r example, mausner a nd evolution offered 
and sold to individuals they did not kno w, through general solic itation, and failed to 
verify whether any of the investor s were accredited investors.   
10. by engaging in this conduc t, defendants violated sections 5(a), 5(c) and 
17(a) of the securities act, 15 u.s.c. §§ 77e (a), 77e(c), and 77q(a) , section 10(b) of 
the exchange act, 15 u.s.c. § 78j(b), rule  10b-5 thereunder, 17 c.f.r. § 240.10b-5, 
sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the advise rs act, 15 u.s.c. §§ 80b-6(1) & 80b-6(2), 
and rule 206(4)-8 thereunder,  17 c.f.r. § 275.206(4)-8.  alternatively, pursuant to 
section 15(b) of the securities act, secti on 20(e) of the exchange act, and section 
209(f) of the advisers act, mausner aided a nd abetted evolution in its violation of case 3:25-cv-01591-btm-vet     document 1     filed 06/23/25     pageid.3     page 3 of 24

10111213141516171819202122232425262728these securities laws provisions. 
11. accordingly, the sec seeks an or der against defendants permanently 
enjoining them from future violations of  these provisions, requiring them to pay 
disgorgement plus prejudgment interest on any ill-gotten gains, and to pay civil 
monetary penalties.

on october 6, 2015, evolution applied, as  an investment business, for foreign

the allegations 
a. mausner’s disciplinary history and investment industry bar 
15. on august 30, 2013, the commission instituted public administrative 
and cease-and-desist proceedings in in the matter of j.s. oliver capital 
management, l.p., et al. , ap file no. 3-15446, release  nos. 9446, 70292, 3658, and 
30682, 2013 sec lexis 2584 (aug. 30, 2013), alleging misconduct by mausner and 
j.s. oliver (collectively, the “respondents” ) for engaging in two distinct schemes: 
fraudulent trade allocation by “cherry-picking”  favorable trades for j.s. oliver’s 
affiliated hedge fund clients to  the detriment of other unf avored client accounts, and 
failures of disclosure with respect to the use of client commission credits.   
16. following an evidentiary hearing, th e administrative law judge issued an 
initial decision on august 5, 2014, fi nding mausner liable for the misconduct 
alleged, and the commission la ter affirmed that liability finding in a june 17, 2016, 
opinion.  id., release nos. 10100, 78098, 4431, and 32152, 2016 sec lexis 2157

securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer  agent, or nationally recognized statistical 
rating organization; (iii) revoked the investme nt adviser registration of j.s. oliver; 
and (iv) ordered res pondents to pay disgorgement and civil penalties (“j.s. oliver 
order 1”).  id.   
17. on august 15, 2016, respondents appealed the commission’s opinion 
to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit, which on july 13, 2018, 
remanded the case to the commission for rehearing. 
18. thereafter, respondents waived re hearing and submitted an offer of 
settlement, which the commi ssion accepted, and on may 16, 2019, the commission 
issued an administrative order: (i) prohibiting respondents from committing or 
causing any future violations of the same securities act, exchange act, and advisers 
act provisions mentioned above; (ii) ba rring mausner from association with any 
broker, dealer, investment adviser, munici pal securities dealer, municipal advisor, 
transfer agent, or nationally recognized sta tistical rating organization; (iii) prohibiting 
mausner from serving or acting as an empl oyee, officer, director, member of an 
advisory board, investment adviser or de positor of, or principal underwriter for, a 
registered investment company or affilia ted person of such investment adviser, 
depositor, or principal underwriter; and (i v) imposing disgorgement obligations on

19. j.s. oliver order 2 also  made a number of speci fic findings related to 
mausner.  for example, it found that mausner, while at j.s. oliver, had 
disproportionately allocated favorable stock trades to certain clie nt accounts (i.e., he 
engaged in “cherrypicking”), ultimately ha rming unfavored clients by approximately 
$10.7 million, and benefitting mausner, who made money on fees and through prior 
investments in the favored accounts.  in the  matter of j.s. oliver capital case 3:25-cv-01591-btm-vet     document 1     filed 06/23/25     pageid.6     page 6 of 24

and 33476, 2019 sec lexis 1169 (may 16, 2019).   j.s. oliver order 2 further 
found that mausner misuse d the money that was accrued from trading commissions 
paid by j.s. oliver clients (known as “sof t dollars”); specifically, he had used soft 
dollars to pay his ex-wife pursuant to his personal obligations in a divorce settlement, 
inflated rent payments to a company that he himself owned, a nd maintenance fees on 
mausner’s personal timeshare  property, all without disclosing such payments.  id.   
b. mausner and evolution establish the fund 
20. despite mausner’s prior di sciplinary history and his investment industry 
bar, at all relevant times, mausner and evolution served as  investment advisers within 
the meaning of section 202(a)(11) of the advisers act [15 u.s.c. §§ 80b-2(a)11)].  
that is, they both, for compensation, enga ged in the business of advising others, 
either directly or through publications and wr itings, as to the value of securities or as 
to the advisability of investing in , purchasing or selling securities.   
21. specifically, in or around february  2018, mausner be gan selling limited 
partnership interests to potential investor s in the fund.  the ppm, which mausner 
emailed to investors, listed evolution as th e general partner and noted that evolution 
had “discretion to invest in a broad and wi de variety of investment opportunities that 
stand to benefit directly or indirectly from the expanding crypt ocurrency industry and 
related business opportunities.”   
22. the ppm also listed mausner as evolu tion’s principal, and stated that 
“[i]n making investment decisions,” fund i nvestors would have to “rely on the advice 
and analysis of the general partner rath er than any specific objective criteria.”  
23. from around december 2020 to january  2022, mausner sold limited 
partnership interests in the fund to approx imately 11 investors, receiving in exchange 
capital contributions tota ling about $413,000.   
24. mausner controlled the funds that thes e investors contributed to the fund 
as capital.  indeed, mausner—as its prin cipal and owner—exerte d total control over case 3:25-cv-01591-btm-vet     document 1     filed 06/23/25     pageid.7     page 7 of 24

23456789
10111213141516171819202122232425262728evolution, including having sole contro l over evolution’s bank accounts and 
investment decisions.   
25. according to the ppm, investors were required to pay evolution “a 
quarterly management fee . . . equal to 0. 50% (2% annually)” of total commitments to 
the fund, as well as a “performance fee e qual to 20% of the profits earned for each 
calendar year.”   
c. violations of the antifraud provi sions:  misrepresentations and 
scheme liability  
1. defendants’ false and misleading statements to investors 
a. false and misleading statements about mausner’s 
disciplinary history 
26. mausner, whose conduct is imputed to evolution, offered and sold 
limited partnership interests in the fund base d, in part, on representations that he 
made to investors in the ppm.   
27. mausner emailed the ppms directly to  prospective fund investors, and 
investors executed subscription agreements  to purchase interests in the fund.  
mausner countersigned those agreements—w hich incorporated the ppm’s terms and 
conditions—as evolutio n’s manager.   
28. mausner, as the principal, owner, and manager of evolution who exerted 
total control over the entity, was the maker of  the statements in the ppm because he 
had ultimate authority over the content of  the ppm and whether and how the ppm 
was communicated to prospective fund investors. 
29. the ppm contained materially fals e and misleading statements.  for 
example, it highlighted the fact that mausne r had more than 30 years of experience in 
the advisory business, founded j.s. oliver , and had held prominent positions in the 
financial advisory and m oney management industry.  these statements were 
materially misleading because they failed to  disclose mausner’s disciplinary history 
for fraudulent conduct, as laid out in j.s. o liver order 1 and j.s. oliver order 2.   case 3:25-cv-01591-btm-vet     document 1     filed 06/23/25     pageid.8     page 8 of 24

23456789
1011121314151617181920212223242526272830. additionally, while the ppm represen ted that mausner was the principal 
of evolution, it failed to disclose that  in 2016, the commission barred mausner from 
associating with any investme nt adviser or acting as an  investment adviser.   
31. mausner, whose conduct is imputed to evolution, also made materially 
false and misleading statements outside of  the ppm, as he failed to disclose his 
disciplinary history to investors when a dvising and reassuring them regarding their 
investments, and when actually confront ed about his disciplinary history.   
32. for example, in may 2022, when an investor confronted mausner via 
text that he had been barred by the se c from acting as a broker or investment 
adviser, mausner falsely res ponded: “i won my case w ith the sec in the supreme 
court.  it was expunged.”  ma usner also falsely told the investor: “true that i can’t 
work for a firm but i can for myself.  but read the settlement agreement!  won the 
supreme court outright and settled remainder with no ad mission of wrong doing.”   
33. the statements that mausner made to this investor were materially false 
and misleading because the j.s. oliver case  never reached the supreme court of the 
united states, was never e xpunged, and concluded with  a settled commission order 
finding that mausner had enga ged in securities and inve stment advisor fraud, and 
barring him from the securities industry.      
b. false and misleading statements about the handling of 
funds  
34. mausner also made statements in the ppm that were mate rially false and 
misleading with respect to how evolution w ould use investor funds.  specifically, the 
ppm represented that the fund sought to cr eate a portfolio “to benefit from the rapid 
growth and burgeoning acceptance of cr yptocurrencies” and the fund would hold 
these crypto assets for the fund’s benef it at “coinbase,” a crypto asset trading 
platform.         
35. in april 2021, mausner supplemented th e representations he made in the 
ppm regarding coinbase serving as the custod ian when he told an investor via email case 3:25-cv-01591-btm-vet     document 1     filed 06/23/25     pageid.9     page 9 of 24  
 10

23456789
10111213141516171819202122232425262728that the fund’s crypto assets were be ing held by “robinhoo d, bitstamp, and 
coinbase . . . the primary ‘custody’  agents in the crypto world.”   
36. together, these statements that maus ner made to the investor regarding 
the use of investor funds were materia lly false and misleading because the fund 
never held any assets, le t alone any crypto assets, in accounts at coinbase, 
robinhood, or bitstamp, for th e benefit of the fund.    
2. defendants engaged in a scheme to defraud 
37. mausner, whose conduct again is imput ed to evolution, not only made 
materially false and misleading statements to the fund invest ors, he also engaged in a 
scheme to defraud in which he raised hundreds of thousands of dollars: (i) when 
concealing the fact that j.s. oliver orde r 1 and j.s. oliver order 2 had found that 
mausner perpetrated inter alia a $10 million cherry-picking scheme at his prior 
advisory firm and accordingl y barred him from the investment advisory industry; (ii) 
through misrepresenting that fund assets woul d be invested in crypto assets held for 
the benefit of the fund at well-known trad ing platforms; and (iii) by disseminating 
these false and misleading statements to investors.     
38. in furtherance of their scheme, de fendants engaged in  further deceptive 
acts when commingling the fund’s assets in a group of bank accounts that mausner 
controlled, namely evolution’s bank ac counts and mausner’s  own personal bank 
accounts.  as a result, these bank account s contained both investor money and money 
from sources completely unrelated to the fund.   
39. for example: 
(a) at mausner’s direction, an inve stor wired $150,000 to evolution’s 
pacific premier bank account on decemb er 28, 2020, which account contained 
money unrelated to the fund. 
(b) at mausner’s direction, an inve stor wired $55,000 to mausner’s 
personal u.s. bank account on october 14,  2021, which account contained money 
unrelated to the fund.   case 3:25-cv-01591-btm-vet     document 1     filed 06/23/25     pageid.10     page 10 of

23456789
10111213141516171819202122232425262728(c) at mausner’s direction, an inve stor wired $20,000 to evolution’s 
u.s. bank account on july 1, 2021, which ac count contained money unrelated to the 
fund. 
(d) at mausner’s direction, an inve stor wired $10,000 to mausner’s 
personal comerica bank account on janu ary 18, 2022, which account contained 
money unrelated to the fund.   
40. by august 2021, mausner had moved a ll the funds in evolution’s bank 
accounts—which still had investor capital contributions—to maus ner’s personal bank 
accounts.   
d. defendants’ commingling of investor funds violated their 
fiduciary duties as investment advisers 
41. as set forth above, at all relevant  times, mausner and evolution were 
investment advisers within the meaning of section 202(a)(11) of the advisers act [15 
u.s.c. §§ 80b-2(a)11)], since they both, for compensation, engaged in the business of 
advising others—in this case a pooled investme nt vehicle—either directly or through 
publications and writings, as to the value of securities or as to the advisability of 
investing in, purchasing or selling securities.  specifically:  
(a) the ppm made it clear that defe ndants advised the fund on its 
investments, explicitly stating that: “in making investment decisions, the [fund] will 
rely on the advice and analysis of [evolu tion] rather than any specific objective 
criteria.”  as such, evolution and mausne r, as evolution’s principal, owner and 
manager, advised on—and wa s responsible for making—por tfolio management and 
investment decisions on behalf of the fund.  
(b) the fund was a pooled investment vehicle because it held itself 
out as being primarily engaged in the bus iness of investing in securities.   
(c) further, defendants were entitled to fees for their investment 
adviser services on behalf of the fund, an d mausner also received compensation as 
principal, owner, and ma nager of evolution.   case 3:25-cv-01591-btm-vet     document 1     filed 06/23/25     pageid.11     page 11 of
24  
 12  
 1
23456789
1011121314151617181920212223242526272842. as investment advisers, defendants owed to the fund a fiduciary duty of 
utmost good faith and full and fair disclosure  of all material facts.  the defendants 
also had an affirmative obligation to em ploy reasonable care to avoid misleading the 
fund.  indeed, even the ppm assured i nvestors that evolution would “act in good 
faith and in the best interest of the [fund], pursuant to its fiduciary duty.”   
43. despite these fiduciary duties a nd obligations, mausner knowingly, 
recklessly, and negligently commingled th e fund’s assets in both evolution’s and 
mausner’s own bank accounts, creating an  undisclosed conflict of interest, and—
through evolution and separa tely—made material misrepresentations and omissions 
to fund investors, in violation of their duties.  
e. the false and misleading stat ements defendants made were 
material 
44. mausner and evolution’s false and misleading statements to investors 
were material.   
45. a reasonable investor would have c onsidered it important when making 
an investment decision to know that maus ner’s “30 years of experience” included a 
disciplinary history for fraudulent c onduct, including his being barred from 
associating with any investment adviser or acting as an investment adviser. 
46. a reasonable investor also would ha ve considered it important when 
making an investment decision to know that that their money was not being used for 
the crypto asset-related investment purpose specified in the ppm.     
47. a reasonable investor would also ha ve considered it important when 
making an investment decision to know that  the fund did not hold any crypto assets 
at the crypto asset trading platform specifi ed in the ppm, or any other platform 
mausner told them would be used as the custodian.   
48. finally, a reasonable investor would have considered it important to 
know when making an investment decision that their funds were being commingled case 3:25-cv-01591-btm-vet     document 1     filed 06/23/25     pageid.12     page 12 of

the fund and withdrawals of money unrelated  to the fund were made.        
f. defendants acted with scienter a nd their conduct was negligent 
49. mausner knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that his and evolution’s 
aforementioned statements to investors we re materially false and misleading.  
further, in making these statements, mausne r failed to behave w ith the level of care 
that a reasonable person would have exer cised under the same circumstances, and 
was thus negligent.  mausner’s state of  mind and negligent conduct are imputed to 
evolution.   
50. further, mausner knew, or was r eckless for not knowing, that 
commingling investor funds with non-investor funds created a conflict of interest and 
violated his fiduciary duties to the fund.  by  commingling investor funds in this way, 
mausner failed to behave with  the level of care that a reasonable person would have 
exercised under the same circ umstances, and his conduct wa s therefore negligent.  
mausner’s state of mind and negligent conduct are imputed to evolution.   
51. mausner’s scienter and failure to act  reasonably under the circumstances 
is demonstrated, in part, by the following:  
(a) even though j.s. oliver order 1 and j.s. oliver order 2 
prohibited him from committing further violati ons of the federal securities laws and 
serving as/associating with an investment a dviser, mausner continued to do all these 
things as described above.   
(b) when an investor confronted mausner via text about his past 
disciplinary history, mausner falsely told the investor that he had won the j.s. oliver 
case at the supreme court, resulting in the case being expunged, when in reality he 
had recently entered into a settlement barring him from the securities industry.      
(c) mausner falsely told an investor th at the fund’s crypto assets were 
stored on various crypto asset trading plat forms, even though he knew that evolution 
did not hold any crypto assets on the platforms.   case 3:25-cv-01591-btm-vet     document 1     filed 06/23/25     pageid.13     page 13 of

g. registration violations: sections 5(a)  and 5(c) of the securities act  
52. the limited partnership interests in the fund that defendants offered and 
sold are securities.   
53. the investors committed money to purch ase limited partnership interests 
in the fund.   
54. mausner pooled the investor funds in to several bank accounts that he 
controlled.   
55. investors relied on mausner to invest  their funds and had no expectation 
that they would be required to participate in efforts to generate the returns.   
56. in fact, the fund’s ppm stated that evolution would “exclusively” make 
“[a]ll decisions regarding the management a nd affairs of the partnership” and that 
“the success of the partnership for the foreseeable future de pends solely on the 
abilities of [evolution].” 
57. as set forth above, mausner also misleadingly touted his extensive 
trading acumen and strategy to generate profits and repres ented that he would make 
all investment decisions for the fund.   
58. no registration statements were file d with the commission in connection 
with the fund offering, and no exemptions to  the registration requirement applied to 
the fund offering, as defendants: 
(a) engaged in a general so licitation when offering shares of the fund;  
(b) offered and sold securities to i nvestors in multiple states; and 
(c) failed to take reasonable steps to verify whether investors were 
accredited.

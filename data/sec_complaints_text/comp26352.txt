complaint  
plaintiff securities and exchange commission ( “sec” ), for its complaint against defendant 
christine m. hunsicker, alleges as follows : 
summary 
1. from at least february 2019 through at least  march  2025 (the “relevant period”), 
christine m. hunsicker (“hunsicker”) – the co -founder, chief executive officer, and chair of 
privately -held caastle, inc. (“caastle”)  – created and disseminated  to investors false financial 
statements while raising  more than $ 250 million for caastle through the offer and sale of preferred 
stock  and common warrants.  
2. hunsicker’s fake financials supported her narrative that caastle, a startup that 
offered a new monetization model called “clothing -as-a-service” to the apparel industry , enjoyed 
rapid and steady revenue growth after a rebrand of the business in 2018, achieved profitability by 
december 2022, experienced exponential increases in profitability thereafter, and was nearing an 
initial public offering or sale . in reality, caastle’s revenues were shrinking, its losses were 
increasing , and the company was never profitable.  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 1 of 32  
2 3. throughout the relevant period, not a single existing or prospective caastle 
investor received accurate monthly, quarterly, or annual caastle financial statements from 
hunsicker .  
4. to effect her scheme, hunsicker took financial reports that she received every 
month from her financial team and created an alternate set of financials with false monthly, 
quarterly, and annual results that supported her narrative  of the company’s success. she provided 
these falsified financial statements to investors upon request.   
5. by 2022, as caastle appeared to be close to reaching profitability, investors 
increasingly began to ask for audit ed financial  statements . to maintain her ruse, hunsicker took 
caastle’s final signed audit report for fiscal year ended september 30, 2021, downloaded it to her 
computer, altered the numbers, removed the going concern statement in the audit opinion letter , 
and provided the falsified audit to investors . after caastle’s long -time auditor terminated its 
relationship with caastle in 2023, hunsicker created her own a udit reports . she falsified  the 
numbers, audit opinion letter s, and notes  for the reports covering fiscal year s ended sept ember 30, 
2022 and 2023, and she forged the former auditor’s signature . 
6. beginning in 2022, hunsicker  also hid from investors  the extent to which caastle 
continued to rely on primary capital raises to fund its operations , and she provided capitalization 
tables that undercounted the number of issued and outstanding shares and that misled investors 
about caastle’s true capital stru cture. many investors believed that, using caastle as a middleman, 
they were indirectly  purchasing discounted shares in secondary transactions from founders, 
employees, and others who needed liquidity for various personal reasons . typically, however, 
these investors were purchasing original i ssue shares directly from caastle . each caastle investor 
owned a smaller percentage of the company than they realized.  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 2 of 32  
3 7. occasionally, hunsicker herself was the undisclosed seller  in secondary 
transaction s, and  received for her preferred shares the price at which caastle was selling shares in 
its then -current funding round, not the negotiated discounted price . in other words, hunsicker 
orchestrated transactions in which she benefitted herself at the company’s and investors’ expense .  
8. hunsicker’s scheme began to unravel  in late 2024, when multiple investors 
reviewed caastle’s falsified 2 023 audit report in hunsicker’s office  and noticed a missing page 
and several  errors inconsistent with the presented document  being a final audit report . an investor  
contacted  the audit firm whose name hunsicker had forged on the report . the firm told the investor 
that they had not been caa stle’s auditor for years .  
9. hunsicker w as forced to resign from caastle’s board of directors on december 
14, 2024. but s he was temporarily allowed to remain as caast le’s ceo, with restrictions , 
including an outright prohibition on her ability to fundraise for caastle and sign  contracts. 
investors were not informed of hunsicker’s actions or departure from the board while the board 
conducted an internal investigation.   
10. hunsicker’s wrongdoing continued. between december 14, 2024 and march 24, 
2025, hunsicker circumvented the board’s restrictions , provided old and new falsified financial 
statements to caas tle investors, including for fiscal -year ended september 30, 2024, and engaged 
in self -dealing transactions in which, among other things, she sold approximately $10 million of 
her personal shares of caas tle to existing investors that were unaware of her fraud .  
11. hunsicker  formally resigned from her position as ceo on march 24,  2025. the 
company began notif ying investors on march 25, 2025.  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 3 of 32  
4 violations  
12. by virtue of the conduct alleged in this complaint, hunsicker violated section

act”) [15 u.s.c. § 77q(a)].  
13. unless hunsicker is restrained and enjoined, she will continue to engage in the 
transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business set forth in this complaint or in transactions, 
acts, practices, and courses of business of similar type and object.  
14. the sec seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil money 
penalties, an officer and director bar, and other appropriate and necessary equitable relief as to 
hunsicker.

securities to investors located worldwide, including investors located within this district.  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 4 of 32  
5 defendant 
17. christine m. hunsicker , age 4 8, resides in lafayette , new jersey  and new york, 
new york . she is the co -founder of gwynnie bee, inc., which was later re named caastle, inc . 
hunsicker was chair of caastle’s board of directors until december 14, 2024, and its ceo until 
march 24, 2025. hunsicker was the public face of caastle. her principal responsibili ties were 
business strategy and raising funds.  
relevant non -party 
18. caastle, inc. is a privately -held delaware corporation headquartered in new york, 
new york . during the relevant period, caastle had distribution centers in ohio and arizona, and 
a wholly-owned subsidiary that employed hundreds of employees in new delhi, india .  
19. hunsicker co-founded caastle under the name  gwynnie bee, inc. in 2011. the 
company commenced operations in 2012 and initially offered  a direct -to-consumer rental 
subscription service focused on apparel for plus -sized women .  
20. commencing in 2017, hunsicker scaled the business and began offering gwynnie 
bee’s underlying technology and logistics services t o third -party apparel brands and retailers, 
enabling those brands and r etailers to offer a rental subscription service to the ir own customers.  
21. in november 2018, hunsicke r changed the company’s name to caastle, inc . as part 
of a corporate rebranding  of caastle as a “ clothing -as-a- service” or  “caas” company . since then, 
caastle has operated as a business- to-business technology and logistics company that, through its 
platform, enables apparel brands and retailers to offer customers subscription- based rentals of 
apparel, with the option to buy. b rands and retailers pay caa stle a fee to use caastle’s proprietary 
technology (including algorithms and analytics) , reverse logi stics (shipping, garment care), and 
infrastructure (customer service).   case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 5 of 32  
6 22. throughout the relevant period, caastle’s head of financ e, who was based in 
new delhi, india, oversaw the company’s book- keeping, accounting, financial planning, and 
treasury function s. caastle’s financial controller  was based i n new york  and reported to the head 
of finance.  
23. throughout the relevant period, caastle’s financial statements were audited by an 
independent outside audit firm . auditor 1 audited caastle’s financial statements for fiscal years 
ending september 30, 2013 through september 30, 2021. auditor 2 audited caastle’s financial 
statements for fiscal years ending september 30, 2022 through september 30, 2023.  
24. for all audited years, the auditors issued “clean ” audit opinions , i.e., audit opinions 
finding that the consolidated financial statements prepared from caastle’s internal books and 
records systems presented fairly , in all material respects,  the company’s financial position at fiscal -
year end, in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principl es (“us gaap”) . for 
all audited years, the audit report was accompanied by a statement expressing substantial doubt as 
to caastle’s ability to continue as a going concern in light of its recurring losses from operations, 
and reliance on future additional debt or equity financing to fund operations . 
25. substantial doubt to continue as a going concern is an accounting concept that 
“relevant conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable that an entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued .” (asc 205 -40-50-4). 
26. throughout the relevant period, caastle had a three -member board of directors .

7 with or provide financial statements or financial information to caastle’s board of directors. the 
board received financial information about the company exclusively from hunsicker during the 
relevant period, until december 2024, but the information they received did not comport with the information reflected in caastle’s internal records .  
27. on june 20, 2025, caa stle filed a petition  for chapter 7 bankruptcy. see  case no.  
25-11187 (d. del. bankr. june 20, 2025).  
facts  
i. hunsicker knowingly created and distributed to investors 
materially false unaudited and audited financial statements  
a. hunsicker’s knowledge of caastle’s true financial performance  
28. hunsicker routinely received financial information from caastle’s finance team 
and, through her involvement in the company’s budgeting process, and her receipt of interim and annual internal financial reports, and draft and final audit reports,  knew or was reckless or 
negligent in not knowing of caastle’s true financial performance  and reliance on primary capital 
raises.   
29. hunsicker reviewed and approved caastle’s annual budget  each year . the annual 
budgets for fiscal years 2019 through 2024 all anticipated large income shortfalls due to low 
revenues and high costs . the company relied on hunsicker to fill the gap between revenue and 
costs by raising capital .  
30. on a monthly basis, hunsicker received from caastle’s financial controller or 
someone acting under her direction, the company’s month -end balance sheet and income 
statement, which included year- to-date data for all prior months in the fiscal year.  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 7 of 32  
8 31. hunsicker also received a monthly management packet . the packet typically 
included monthly financial statements and was stored  on a shared drive to which hunsicker had 
access.  
32. at the conclusion of every audit, hunsicker received from caastle’s financial 
controller or head of finance a copy of caastle’s final signed audit report. she also periodically 
requested and received drafts of caastle’s audit reports.  
b. hunsicker  doctor ed and provide d to investors   
materially false financials  for fiscal years ended 2018 through 2023 
33. by no later than february 2019, three months after hunsicker rebranded the 
company and changed its name to caastle, hunsicker began to create and disseminate to current 
and prospective caastle investors materially  false financial statements in connection with her 
capital -raising efforts for caastle .  
34. hunsicker provided materially false financial statements to investors for 
approximately 6 years , during which time caastle raised more than $ 250 million in capital from 
investors who were unaware that the financial information they received was entirely a fiction .  
35. throughout that time, investors routinely asked for financial statements as part of 
their original and continuing due diligence on the company. some required financial statements 
because their own financial statements were  audited and their auditors needed to value their 
holdings in caastle. accurate financial statements were important to investors .  
36. as alleged in further detail  below, i n early 2019, hunsicker’s falsified financial 
statements for fiscal year ended september 30, 2018, reported gross annual revenues of $71.5 
million, a 187% inflation of caastle’s actual gross revenues, which were $24.9 million. the 
discrepancy between hunsicker’s misstated financial results and the company’s actual results continued to grow in magnitude year-over- year, as reflected in the below chart:   case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 8 of 32

37. at all times, hunsicker was the sole caastle employee to communicate with and 
provide financial information to investors . her finance team, including caastle’s head of finance 
and financial controller, did not provide financial statements to investors.  
i. hunsicker falsified caastle’s fiscal 2018 financials  
38. by no later than january 22, 2019, as part of their monthly review of caastle ’s 
financial results, hunsicker’s finance team provided hunsicker with the company’s then -current 
unaudited income statement for the full fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 (“fiscal year 
2018”), generated from caastle’s internal records. these internal records reflected fiscal 2018 
revenues of $ 23.4 million , operating losses of $ 46.6 million , and net losses of $55.6 . hunsicker 
also had access to this information on the company’s shared drive .  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 9 of 32  
10 39. despite having access to company internal records, on  february 24, 2019, 
hunsicker emailed a prospective investor , who had been asking for financials  for months , a 
document that  she herself created. the document purported to be caastle’s f iscal 2018 income 
statement  but instead was a fake. it reflected r evenue s of approximately $71.5 million and 
operating losses of approximately $ 24.1 million  for the fiscal year.  
40. hunsicker subsequently provided the same fake fiscal 2018 income statement to at 
least nine other investors . some of them invested for the first time or added to their investments 
after receiving these false financials.  
41. for example, between may 13 and june 16, 2019, hunsicker provided an investor 
with multiple copies of the fake 2018 income statement, along with other falsified interim period 
financials and projections . on june 2 7, 2019, the investor signed a stock purchase agreement , and 
on june 28, 2019, the investor wired $2 million to purchase caastle series a -11 preferred shares .  
42. hunsicker knew or was reckless or negligent in not knowing the fiscal 2018 
numbers she provided to investors were materially false and did not reflect the information in caastle’s internal system of records.  
43. hunsicker later received a copy of caastle’s final audit report for fiscal year 2018 , 
which auditor 1 completed and caastle’s finance team sent to her on february 7, 2020. the 
audited income s tatement  reported revenue of approximately $24.9 million and operating losses 
of approximately $53.6 million for fiscal y ear 201 8, which largely comported  with the unaudited 
internal financial records that hunsicker  had received  from her finance team. the audited financial 
statement s were accompanied by a clean audit opinion  with auditor 1’s  conclusion that 
caastle’s fiscal year 2018 financial stateme nts presented fairly, in all material respects, caastle’s 
financial position in accordance with us gaap .  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 10 of 32  
11 44. caastle’s  fiscal year 2018 audit report confirmed to hunsicker the falsity of the 
fiscal 2018 financial statements that she sent to investors. she did not send the fiscal year 2018 
audit r eport to any investors , provide investors with corrected fiscal 2018 financial information , or 
tell investors that the fiscal 2018 financial information they received from her was inaccurate.  
ii. hunsicker falsified caastle’s fiscal 2019 financials  
45. by no later than november 11, 2019, hunsicker’s finance team emailed her the 
company’s then- current unaudited income statement for the full fiscal year ended september 30, 
2019 (“fiscal year 2019”), generated from caastle’s internal records. these internal records 
reflected fiscal 2019 revenues of approximately $ 27.7 million , operating losses of approximately 
$54.4, and net losses of approximately $57 million. hunsicker also had access to this information 
on the company’s shared drive.  
46. despite her access to the company’s internal records, o n april 19, 2020, after an 
existing investor asked for an update of the business, hunsicker created and emailed the investor 
what purported to be caastle’s  fiscal 2019 income statement . the income statement was a fake 
that hunsicker herself created . the income statement reflected revenue of approximately  $89.8 
million and operating losses of approximately $27.7 million for the fiscal year.  
47. hunsicker subsequently provided her fake f iscal 2019 income statement to least six 
other caastle investors, knowing that they were materially wrong . some of them invested for the 
first time or added to their investments after receiving these financials .  
48. hunsicker knew or was reckless or negligent in not knowing that that the f iscal 
2019 income statement did not reflect the information in caastle’s internal system of records .  
49.  furthermore, on august 4, 2020, hunsicker received a copy of caastle ’s final 
audit report for fiscal year 2019 , which auditor 1 completed and signed on the same date . the case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 11 of 32  
12 audited financial statements  reported revenue of approximately $26 million and operating losses 
of approximately $58.2 million for f iscal year 2019, which largely comported with the unaudited 
internal financial records that hunsicker received from her finance team .  
50. caastle’s fiscal y ear 2019 audit r eport confirmed to hunsicker the falsity of the 
fiscal 2019 financial statements that she sent to investors. she did not send the fiscal year 2019 
audit report to any investor, or provide any investor with corrected fiscal 2018 financial 
information, or tell any investor that the information she had previously sent was materially inaccurate. she instead  continued to send her doctored fiscal 2019 income statement  to investors 
51. yet, on september 7, 2020, hunsicker provided an investor with a copy of the fake 
2019 income statement . the investor signed a stock purchase agreement and warrant purchase 
agreement on november 6, 2020. the next day, the investor wired $1.5 million to caastle to 
purchase caastle series a -11 preferred shares and common warrants.  
iii. hunsicker  falsified caastle’s fiscal 20 20 financials  
52. by no later than november 24, 2020, hunsicker’s finance team provided her with 
caastle’s then-current unaudited income statement for the full fiscal year ended september 30, 
2020 (“fiscal year 2020”), generated from caastle’s internal records. these internal records 
reflected fiscal 2020 revenue of approximately $ 24.7 million , operating losses of approximately 
$42.6 million, and net losses of approximately $44.9 million.  hunsicker also had access to this 
information on the company’s shared drive.  
53. by march 6, 2021, hunsicker created and emailed to an existing investor a 
document that  purported to be caastle’s f iscal 2020 income statement . the income statement was 
a fake that hunsicker herself cr eated. it reflected r evenue of approximately $93.3 million and 
operating losses of approximately $29.9 million  for the fiscal year.  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 12 of 32  
13 54. hunsicker subsequently provided the same fake fiscal 2020 income statement to at 
least ten other caastle investors. some of them invested for the first time or added to their 
investments after receiving these financials.  
55. for example, on april 19, 2021, hunsicker emailed an existing investor a copy of 
the fake 2020 income statement and a slide deck on the company, in response to his standing 
request that hunsicker keep him better informed and provide more regular financial updates. on 
august 9, 2021, hunsicker emailed  the investor to inform him that the company was looking to 
raise $15 million to $20 million in additional capital, and wrote , “i would love for you to do some 
more.” the investor  signed a stock purchase agreement  and wired $2 million to caastle on august 
20, 2021, for the purchase of caastle series a -12 preferred shares .  
56. hunsicker  knew or was reckless or negligent in not knowing that the f iscal 2020 
numbers she sent to investors were materially false and did not reflect the information in caastle’s 
internal system of records.  
57. on may 24, 2021, hunsicker received a copy of caastle’s final audit report for 
fiscal year 2020 , which auditor 1 completed and signed  on the same date. the audited 
financial statements  reported revenue of approximately $25 million and operating losses of  
approximately $45.3 million for f iscal year 2020, which largely comported with the internal reports 
received by hunsicker  received from her finance team . the audited financial statements were 
accompanied by a clean audit opinion with auditor 1’s conclusion that caastle’s fiscal year 
2020 financial statements presented  fairly,  in all material respects, caastle’s financial position in 
accordance with us gaap .  
58. caastle’s fiscal year 20 20 audit report confirmed to hunsicker the falsity of the 
fiscal 2020 financial statements that she sent to investors. she did not send the fiscal year 2020 case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 13 of 32  
14 audit report to any investor, or provide any investor with corrected fiscal 2020 financial 
information, or tell any investor that the information she had previously sent was materially inaccurate. indeed, she continued to send her doctored fiscal 2020 income statement to investors. 
iv. hunsicker falsified caastle’s fiscal 2021 financials  and audit report  
59. in late 2021, shortly after the close of fiscal year ended september 30, 2021 (“fiscal 
year 2021”), one of caastle’s earliest investors told  hunsicker that they would not commit 
additional investment funds to caastle, unless the company started to provide audited financials 
and to provide financial updates more regularly. other investors inquired about when caastle 
would have audited financials  as well . hunsicker began to tell investors that caastle would have 
audited financials in 2022.  
60. on february 22, 2022, auditor 1 completed its audit for caastle’s fiscal year 
2021 and hunsicker received a copy of the final audit report that day. auditor 1 completed 
caastle’s audit on a more accelerated timeline that year than in prior years . the audited financial 
statements reported fiscal year 2021 revenues of approximately $ 18.6 million  and operating 
losses of approximately $ 32.3 million , which also largely comported with the unaudited internal 
financial records that hunsicker earlier received from h er finance team . the audited financial 
statements were accompanied by a clean audit opinion with auditor 1’s conclusion that 
caastle’s fiscal year 2021 financial statements presented fairly, in all material respects,  caastle’s 
financial position in accordance with us gaap.  
61. the fiscal year 2021 audit report did not comport with the narrative that hunsicker 
had been telling investors . therefore, c onsistent with her handling of prior fiscal year audit reports, 
hunsicker did not send the fiscal year 2021 audit report to any investor.  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 14 of 32  
15 62. when investors inquire d about the status of the  fiscal year 2021  audit  in 2022, 
hunsicker provided different excuses for the delay, to buy herself time . on june 22, 2022, four 
months after auditor 1 issued its final audit report, hunsicker told  one investor that caastle 
was still in the process of engaging an auditor . as 2022 progressed, hunsicker told investors that, 
as a private company, caas tle was not high on the auditor’s priority list, and the audit was slow -
going and not complete . investors began to express concern about the audit delays.  
63. hunsicker  ultimately decided, after having told investors that they can expect to see 
audited financials in 2022, to falsify caastle’s fiscal year 2021 audit report to provide a falsified 
audit to investors.   
64. on or around november 30, 2022, hunsicker asked her finance team to locate a 
non-final draft of the fiscal year 2021 audit report. the finance team did not ask why she wanted 
a draft and, on november 30, 2022, emailed hunsicker a draft in word, with a note that it was the 
latest draft they could locate . hunsicker took the draft, altered the numbers to support her narrative, 
changed the audit opinion letter to remove the going concern opinion, and then added the words 12/2/2022 draft to the front page before  sending a pdf copy to the investor.  
65. on december 2, 2022, hunsicker emailed an investor what purported to be a draft 
of the fiscal year 2021 audit report . she lied to the investor and told him that caastle’s accounting 
team and the auditor were  still “turning versions” of the audit report but that the draft  was “further 
along than [she] expected.” the draft contained an income statement that reflected revenue of 
approximately $120.5 million for the fiscal year – a material improvement over the prior fiscal 
year – and operating losses of $33.7 million. the draft contained a balance sheet that reflected a 
cash balance of appro ximately $30.2 million  as of september 30, 2021. these numbers were 
materially  false  and not reflective of caastle’s internal records .  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 15 of 32  
16 66. between december 2022 and march 2023, hunsicker provided the falsified draft 
fiscal year 2021 audit report to at least eight caastle investors, though she knew or was reckless 
or negligent in not knowing that the draft was a complete fake and that the financial information 
reflected in it was materially false .  
67. from march 2023 through at least august 2023, hunsicker emailed at least 15 
investors what purported to be a final fiscal year 2021 audit report . the “final” too was a fake 
that reflected financial performance data similar to what had been reflected in the “draft” – 
materially overstated revenues of approximately $120.5 million, operating losses of  approximately 
$33.7 million, and a materially inflated cash balance of approximately $30.3 million  as of 
september 30, 2021. hunsicker changed the numbers, removed the auditor’s going concern 
opinion, and inserted auditor 1’s signature on to the doctored audit opinion letter. she dated 
the opinion letter as of march 26, 2023, making it appear that auditor 1 had just completed the 
audit and finalized the report.  
68. hunsicker knew or was reckless or negligent in not knowing that the fiscal year 
2021 audit report had been finalized and signed by auditor 1 ten months earlier and that “draft” and “final” versions she created and sent to investors w ere complete fakes and materially misstated 
caastle’s true financial performance .  
v. hunsicker falsified caastle’s fiscal 202 2 financials and audit report 
69. in march  2023, hunsicker announced to investors that caastle had generated a 
profit and become cash flow positive for the first time in the quarter ending december 31, 2022 . 
she supported her statement by providing investors with a false interim financial statement that 
was not reflective of caastle’s internal financial records . caastle, in fact, had not become 
profitable or cash flow positive  by december 2022.  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 16 of 32  
17 70. hunsicker’s announcement  increased the appetite of caastle investors for audited 
financial statements , which hunsicker  appeased by creat ing a fake draft audit report with fake 
financial statements and fake notes  for fiscal  year ended september 30, 2022 (“fiscal year 2022”) , 
and then creat ing a fake final fiscal year 2022 audit report, to which she added auditor 1’s 
signature .  
71. on april 4, 2023, hunsicker emailed two existing and prospective investor s what 
purported to be a n april 3, 2023 draft of the fiscal year 202 2 audit report. she told the investor s 
that caastle’s auditor was working through “presentation issues,” completing its audit of the 
capitalization table, and finalizing the notes , suggesting that the financial statements in the draft 
report were near -final or final. in reality , the draft was a fake created by hunsicker herself . the 
income statement reflected revenue of approximately $ 238.5 million for the fiscal year, nearly 
double the amount that had been reflected in the fake fiscal year 2021 audit report . the balance 
sheet reflected a cash balance of approximately $ 42.5 million as of september 30, 2022. these 
numbers did not comport with caastle’s internal records . the accompanying audit opinion letter 
and notes were devoid of any reference to caastle as a going concern .  
72. one day after receiving hunsicker’s falsified “ draft ” of the fiscal year 2022 audit 
report, a prospective investor  that had tracked caastle’s fake financial performance for years, 
sought authorization from its investment committee to commit  $7.5 million to purchase shares of 
caastle’s series a -12 preferred stock and common warrants . the false data that hunsicker sent to 
the investor – including fake fiscal 2021 and 2022 financial data – was important to the investor’s 
decision- making process . the investor s igned a stock purchase agreement, a warrant purchase 
agreement, and other transactional documents, and wired $7.5 million to caastle’s bank account 
on april 11, 2023.  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 17 of 32  
18 73. from september 2023 through at least march 2024, hunsicker provided at least 10 
investors with a document that purported to be a final fiscal year 2022 audit report . the document 
reflected false financial performance data similar to what had been reflected in the “draft” – 
materially overstated revenues of approximately $238.5 million  that were nearly double that of the 
prior year, operating losses of  approximately $17.1 million  that were nearly half of the prior fiscal 
year, and a materially inflated cash balance of approximately $42.5 million as of september 30, 
2022. hunsicker cut and pasted into the document auditor 1’s signature  from a prior year’s 
audit report . like the fake draft, hunsicker’s fake final fiscal year 2022 audit report did not 
express warnings about caastle’s ability to continue as a going concern or its need to continue to 
raise capital to continue as a going concern .  
74. hunsicker knew or was reckless or negligent in not knowing that the financial 
information reflected in the draft and final fiscal year 2022 audit reports that she provided to investors was materially false and did not comport with caastle’s internal records . while creating 
the false reports, she was in possession of the internal financial statements and records that her 
finance team sent earlier. the internal records reflected fiscal 2022 revenues of approximately $20 
million , operating losses of approximately $34.1 million, and net losses of approximately $40 
million, and a september 30, 2022 cash balance of approximately $621,000.  
75. hunsicker also knew when she sent the fake draft and final fiscal year 2022 audit 
reports that: (a) caastle was experiencing a severe cash crunch and had instructed auditor 1 to 
stop working on caastle’s fiscal year 2022 audit in september 2023 and (b) auditor 1 had 
terminated its relationship with caastle  in early october 2023 in a written letter addressed to 
hunsicker .  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 18 of 32  
19 76. caastle’s new auditor, auditor 2, completed the fiscal year 2022 audit on 
december 2, 2024. t he audited financial statements reported fiscal year 2022 revenues of 
approximately $19.7 million and operating losses of approximately $58.5 million, and a cash 
balance of less than $750 ,000 as of september 30, 2022. these numbers were materially consistent 
with the internal reports that hunsicker had received before sending her falsified fiscal 2022 
financials to investors .  
77. the audit report was accompanied by a clean audit opinion with auditor 2’s 
conclusion that caastle’s financial statements for fiscal year 202 2 presented fairly, in all material 
respects, caastle’s financial position in accordance with us gaap. the audit report noted that 
that “ [caast le] has suffered recurring losses from operations and requires additional debt or equity 
financing in the future to continue to fund its operations, which cannot be guaranteed. these factors 
raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.”  
78. hunsicker received a copy of the final audit report on december 2, 2024. she did 
not send the r eport to any investors or provide investors with corrected fiscal year 2022 financial 
information.  
vi. hunsicker  lied to cover her tracks  
relating to caastle’s fiscal 202 2 financials and audit report  
79. hunsicker’s scheme nearly unraveled in october 2023 before she sent misleading 
financial statements to any i nvestor for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023. h er lies kept the 
scheme alive for over one more year .  
80. in september 2023, an investor who received the fake fiscal year 2022 audit report 
from hunsicker noticed errors in the report that suggested it might not be fin al. the investor  
emailed the fake report to auditor 1 and asked if auditor 1 had “conducted and completed” 
the audit for fiscal year 2022 . auditor 1 told the investor tha t the report was  “not signed by case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 19 of 32  
20 [auditor 1]” and was  “not a legitimate [auditor 1] opinion .” auditor 1 contacted 
caastle’s head of finance and financial controller and hunsicker . hunsicker explained that this 
was a one- off error. she claimed  that she had mistakenly sent the investor a marked up version of 
the audit report that she intended to use in a lecture she was giving at princeton university on 
ethics and entrepreneurship.  
81. auditor 1  terminated its relationship with caastle on october 3, 2023. a lthough 
skeptical of hunsicker’s story , auditor 1 did not report her to the board of directors. caastle’s 
head of finance and financial controller believed hunsicker’s excuse and also did not report her 
to the board of directors. caastle r edeemed the investor ’s shares at cost , and the investor did not 
report hunsicker to the board of directors.  
82. although hunsicke r took out personal loa ns and provide d the proceeds to caastle 
to enable it to redeem the investor’s shares, the loans came from caastle investors who were 
misled about how she intended to use the loan proceeds . she ultimately repaid a majority of the 
loans by selling some of her personal shares of caastle preferred stock to an investor who had 
received false financials from her and w as unaware  of her fraud . the investor forgave his own $4 
million loan to hunsicker and then paid an additional $3.5 million purportedly to purchase $7.5 
million some of her personal shares at a discounted price. she attempted to repay the rest of her 
personal loans by wiring funds from caastle’s bank account to the investor -lender , who has since 
returned the funds to caastl e, and insisted that hunsicker pay the loan from her personal funds . 
83. with the board of directors unaware of hunsicker’s actions, or the real reason why 
auditor 1 had terminated its relationsh ip with caastle, hunsicker continue d her scheme .  
84. exactly two business day s after auditor 1 terminated its relationship with 
caastle, hunsicker sent  to a long- term caastle investor the fake  fiscal year 2022 final audit report case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 20 of 32  
21 that auditor 1 had denounced. the investor purchased additional shares of caastle ’s a-12 
preferred stock and common warrants days later  for its own account and an account held for the 
benefit of a client  for over $2.5 million.   
85. in march 2024, hunsicker sent the fake fiscal year 2022 audit report to another 
existing caastle investor. in april 2024, the investor purchased more than $15 million additional 
preferred shares and common warrants for itself and a group of co-investors. 
vii. hunsicker falsified caastle’s fiscal 202 3 financials and audit report 
86. on september 24, 2024, as part of her continuing efforts to raise capital for caastle, 
hunsicker gave an investor access to a data room that contained a purported final audit report for 
fiscal years end ed september 30, 2022 and 2023 . the document was a fake  created by hunsicker . 
the financial statements reflected fiscal 2023 revenues of approximately $439.9 million, total 
profits of approximately $66.3 million, and a cash balance of approximately $112.8 million as of 
september 30, 2023, which did not comport with caastle’s internal records .   
87. hunsicker knew or was reckless or negligent in not knowing that the fiscal 2023 
financial information reflected in the audit report was materially false and did not comport with 
caastle’s internal records.  
88. caastle’s true fiscal year 2023 financial performance was dismal in comparison . 
caastle’s internal records – which hunsicker had received from her finance team beforehand – 
reflected fiscal 202 3 revenues of approximately $ 15.6 million , operating losses of approximately 
$39.6 million, net losses of approximately $47.2  million, and a september 30, 2023 cash balance 
of approximately $880,000.  
89. hunsicker also knew when she sent the fake fiscal year 2022-2023 audit report to 
investors that auditor 2 had not completed its fiscal 2023 audit yet . she drafted the report . she case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 21 of 32  
22 cut and pasted auditor 1’s signature into the report from a prior audit. she scanned the 
document to herself.  
90. the fake fiscal year 2022- 2023 audit report contained multiple facial errors. it was  
missing page 7, the stockholders’ equity report ; the notes were out -of-date; and t he audit opinion 
letter purported to be signed by auditor 1 on august 30, 2024.   
91. within days of receiving the  fake fiscal year 2022- 2023 audit report from 
hunsicker, the investor described in paragraph 86 wired more than $25 million to caastle to 
purchase preferred shares and common warrants.  
92. several  weeks later , hunsicker offered two different investors an opportunity to 
view the supposed final fiscal year  2022- 2023 audit report in her office . both investors accepted 
the offer. they were shown the same fake audit report that hunsicker had loaded to the data room 
on september 24.   
93. auditor 2 completed caastle ’s fiscal year 202 3 audit on december 2, 2024, 
and issued it as a joint fiscal year 2022- 2023 audit report . the audit ed financial statements  
reported fiscal 2023 revenues of approximately $ 15.7 million , operating losses of approximately 
$80.7 million, and a cash balance of less than $ 950,000 as of september 30, 2023. these numbers 
were materially consistent with the internal reports that hunsicker had received from her finance 
team before sending falsified fiscal 202 3 financials to investors , except for the audited  loss figure 
which was materially larger in comparison to the company’s internal records.  
94. caastle was not profitable or cash -flow positive in fiscal year 2023. nor was it 
financing operations from its own cash flow. it had less than $1 million in cash and had suffered its largest losses to date. the real fiscal year 2022- 2023 audit report noted that that “ [caast le] 
has suffered recurring losses from operations and requires additional debt or equity financing in case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 22 of 32  
23 the future to continue to fund its operations, which cannot be guaranteed. these factors raise 
substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.”  this is the same message that 
previously appeared in every one of caastle’s “real” audit reports.  
ii. hunsicker procure d investments  using misleading sales tactics  
95. by mid -2022, hunsicker  also hid from investors the extent to which caastle 
continued to rely on primary capital raises to fund its operations, and she provided capitalization 
tables that misled investors about caastle’s true capital structure. i nvestors who wanted to 
participate in secondary transactions ended up mostly participating in primary offerings, and 
investor interests were diluted  as a result .  
96. prior to 2022, caastle raised  capital by selling original issue common shares and 
successive rounds of preferred shares to investors . by late 2021, hunsicker began to tell investors 
that caastle had largely completed its capital -raising rounds and was moving into a  final “pre- ipo 
round.” by july 2022, she told investors that caastle was close to “generating cash” and may not 
have another capital -raising round. the false financial statements she provided to investors  in 
march 2023 fit her inaccurate narrativ e and falsely represented that  caastle had become profitable  
and cash flow  positive by december 31, 2022, and was capable of generating sufficient revenue 
to independently fund its operations without the need for primary capital raises. caastle’s fake fiscal year 2022- 2023 audit report represented that caastle had not raised capital since the end of 
fiscal 2022.  
97. in reality, caastle’s financial performance had worsened, and caastle relied on 
hunsicker’s continued ability to raise capital in order to survive . investors were unaware of this 
fact. several investors only invested because they believed  they were buying discounted shares in 
secondary transactions. if they had known that caastle was continuing to raise capital – when its case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 23 of 32  
24 balance sheet suggested that caastle has cash -rich – that information would have influenced their 
investment decision.  
98. hunsicker structure d the supposed “secondary transactions” in a manner that 
allowed  her to conceal the true nature of the transaction s as a primary capital- raising event s. she 
told prospective buyers that she was facilitating resales from early investors in caastle who were 
facing liquidity issues or other requirements to sell their shares . then, a cting as intermediary, she 
purported to negotiate the transaction on behalf of both sides . the buyers had no contact with the 
supposed sellers . the buyer s execute d transactional documents with caastle and wired funds to 
caastle, and  caastle was supposed to use the proceeds to purchase shares from the seller.  
99. the selling investors that hunsicker described, for the most part, did not exist. the 
majority of the shares sold in purported secondary transactions were newly issued caastle shares. caastle used the funds for operations.   
100. for example , on august 16, 2023, hunsicker solicited a prospective investor, 
telling him she had “an employee who desperately needs some liquidity for an elder care situation.” hunsicker told the prospective investor that caastle would act as middleman by purchasing the shares from the employee and then sellin g shares to the investor. the selling employee that 
hunsicker described did not exist . the buyer purchased one million shares, believing the shares 
would come from reissuances of previously issued shar es. caastle then issued a mix of new 
preferred and common shares to the buyer . the investor’s new shares increased the number of 
outstanding shares by one million, as reflected on caastle’s internal capitalization table. hunsicker 
made the same offer concerning the same fictitious seller to multiple other investors, several of 
whom purchase d shares in transactions that caas tle recorded as original share issuances.  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 24 of 32  
25 101. occasionally, hunsicker herself was the seller in a secondary  transaction, though 
she concealed her identity from the buyer , and caastle paid her full price to redeem her shares, 
not the negotiated discounted price paid by the buyer.  
102. for example, on july 25, 2022, hunsicker emailed an existing caastle investor with 
an opportunity to purchase shares from another caastle investor who she claimed had become a 
director of a large chinese public company and was being pushed by the “[c]hinese gov[ernmen]t … to sell his us tech stocks .” hunsicker told the investor that “because [the seller] is getting 
pressure, he’s willing to do a substantial discount on his shares” at a price of $2.05 per share, which hunsicker described as a 67% discount to the price at which caastle sold shares in its last 
fundraising round. a day later, after the investor stated that he  needed time to determine how much 
he could invest, hunsicker told the investor that the seller would be willing to sell 25% of his available shares to the investor for $1.50 per share . hunsicker then pressured the investor to act, 
telling him that caastle would likely not do another funding round “since we are so close to 
generating cash.” hunsicker also sent the investor false income statements covering the period january through june 2022 and a false balance sheet as of june 30, 2022.  
103. the investor agreed to purchase the shares at $1.50 per share and wired 
approximately $500,000 to caa stle the next day. caa stle recorded it as paid in capital. ca astle 
then purchased preferred shares from hunsicker, not an executive of a chinese public company , 
and it paid her $6.20 per share , not $1.50.   
104. hunsicker made the same offer to sell shares from the same fictitious investor to 
multiple other investors . one of them purchased shares in a transaction that the company recorded 
as an original share issuance. the proceeds from that sale were not used to repurchase shares from 
hunsicker or any other real selling investor . caastle used the funds for operations.  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 25 of 32  
26 105. to hide that these transactions were capital raises and not true secondary sales, 
hunsicker created and distributed false capitalization tables that omitted  the new share issuances 
and made it appear that outstanding share levels remained flat . for example, in response to a 
january 1, 2024 request from an existing investor for the capitalization table, hunsicker provided 
a table that undercounted the outstanding shares at the time by more than 50 million shares (out of approximately 260 million) . the table  show ed the amount of shares that the investor expected.  
106. hunsicker  further deceived the investor with her explanation that “[t]he changes 
from the last cap table are: your investments, retiring common shares, option grants during our annual cycle and options that have exercised to common.” the changes hunsicker mentioned amounted to negligible sums . hunsicker omitted mention of any new share issuances from capital 
raising in her statement.  
107. caastle’s records show that, between december  2021 and july 2023, hunsicker 
was the only shareholder on the  sell side of a secondary transaction, redeeming a total of 
approximately 675,000 shares , for which caastle paid her $6.20 per share, or more than $4 million.  
108. caastle’s records also show that, i n the aggregate, between january 2022 and 
december 2024, caastle raised capital through the sale of 100 million newly issued caastle shares. these issuances caused caastle to exceed the number of authorized share totals  in 2023. 
the board of directors later purportedly retroactively increased the number of authorized 
outstanding shares of common stock from 255 million to 350 million (a 37% increase) and the number of outstanding shares of preferred stock from 136,100,000 t o 152,850,000 (a 12% 
increase).  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 26 of 32  
27 iii. caastle’s board of directors learned of  
hunsicker’s deception and the scheme ultimately unraveled  
109. hunsicker’s scheme was ultimately  uncovered by an investor who had reviewed 
caastle’s purported “final” fiscal year 2023 audit report in hunsicker’s office  on october 30, 
2024. after noticing that the report was missing a page and appeared to contain other errors that 
hunsicker was unable to explain , the investor asked hunsicker for a contact at auditor 1, the 
audit firm whose signature was on the report.  
110. the investor contacted  auditor 1 and was told that auditor 1 did not conduct 
the at -issue audit  and that caastle was not an active client .  
111. the investor told hunsicker  of its call with auditor 1 and a sked for an  
explanation. hunsicker’s response came days later . she acknowledged, without specifying  the 
details, that there was “a problem, ” and she gave the investor two options: (i)  do nothing and give 
hunsicker time to “fix” the issue  because there was “value” in the company or (ii) redeem their 
shares. the investor chose neither option and instead reported hunsicker to caastle’s board of 
directors.  
112. hunsicker resigned from caastle’s board of directors on december 14, 2024, after 
admitting to her co -founder and a board member that she provided false financial information to 
investors.  
113. hunsicker was allowed to remain as caastle’s ceo while the board conducted a 
further investigation, but during that time, restrictions were place d on her  authority . she was 
prohibited from , among other things,  raising capital for caastle or communicating with investors 
on caastle’s behalf. any action she took required board approval.  case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 27 of 32  
28 114. while the board undertook its investigation, investors were not notified of 
hunsicker’s departure from the board or made aware of  the concerns that an investor had raised 
with the board.  
115. between december 14, 2024 and march 24, 2025, hunsicker circumvented the 
board’s restrictions and took advantage of the fact that investors remained unaware of her 
wrongdoing, sold or purported to sell  her own shares of caastle stock to existing investors in 
secondary transactions.   
116. on or about december 30, 2024, hunsicker entered into an agreement with a large 
existing investor in which she purported to sell some or all of her personal shares. the agreement was not documented in writing and hunsicker asked the investor to wire the funds to her personal bank account, not caastle . between january 9, 2025 and january 22, 2025, the investor wired 
$9,625,000 to hunsicker’s personal bank account. the investor was not aware that every financial statement that hunsicker had ever provided to t hem was materially false .   
117. a few weeks later, in february 2025, hunsicker approached another investor an d 
offered to sell the  investor  9,300,000 shares of her preferred and common stock at a price of $2.15 
per share. the investor was interested and, as part of its due diligence, asked hunsicker for a copy of the final fiscal 2023 audit report and cap table. on march 11, 2025, hunsicker provided the investor with the same fake fiscal 2023 audit that she had provided to investors in 2024, which led 
to her resignation from the board. the investor noticed a number of errors and inconsistencies in the audit report and did not go through with the transaction.   
118. on or about march 18, 2025, hunsicker provided  another investor with a document 
that purported to be caastle’s income statement for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2024 
(“fiscal year 2024”), which reflected revenue of more than $ 848 million and losses of case 1:25-cv-05897     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 28 of 32  
29 approximately $192.2 million for the fiscal year. these numbers were materially false and had no 
basis in reality. caastle’s internal records show fiscal 2024 revenues of approximately $11.3 
million and losses of approximately $69 million.  
119. hunsicker formally resigned as caastle’s ceo on march 24, 2025.  
120. on march 25, 2025, the board of directors started to inform investors. in a letter 
to investors dated march 29, 2025, the board notified investors that hunsicker had stepped down as ceo and as a director, and acknowledged that the company’s “performance to date has not matched what hunsicker claimed.” the letter further stated that it learned that “[hunsicker] provided certain investors with misstated financial statements and falsified audit opinions, as we ll 
as capitalization information that understated the number of shares outstanding.” the letter advised investors not to rely on any financial or capitalization information received from hunsicker in the past and it attached caastle’s true fiscal 202 2 and 2023 audit report.

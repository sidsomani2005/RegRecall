 v.  cheetah x inc. (d/b/a go x),

       / 
  
complaint  for injunctive and other relief  
and demand for jury trial  
 
plaintiff securities and exchange commission ( the “commission”) alleges  as follows: 
i. introduction 
1. from approximately july 2021 through november 2023, defendants cheetah x 
inc., which does business as “go x” (“go x”) ; go x’s founder , majority owner, and ceo , 
alexander debelov (“debelov”) ; and go x’s  president of o perations , khodr salam , a/k/a khodor 
salam  (“salam”) (collectively, “defendants”)  raised approximately $4 million from about 300 
investors located across multiple states , through the fraudulent and unregistered sale of securities .   
2. go x operates a scooter  rental business in markets  including several florida cities, 
honolulu, and las v egas.  defendants promoted go x’s investment program on its public website , 
in videos posted on youtube, in direct communications with prospective investors, and in written 
agreements .  case 1:25-cv-23002-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 07/03/2025   page 1 of 20

 3. in their sales pitch, defendants represented to investors that go x would pay 
investors a share of its gross profits from scooter rental  fees, in exchange for the investors ’ principal 
payment to go x, which typically ranged from $2,000 to $30,000.  they  also represented that 
through the profit -sharing, investors could expect to be paid back their principal plus receive 
returns up to 100 percent in a year or less. t he go x website claim ed that investors had  earned  
more than $3 million  by august 2022.  in addition, defendants portrayed go x as less risky than 
investing in the s&p 500, touting “guaranteed” investor refunds upon request and claiming that 
investor funds could be lost only if go x went out of business.  
4. these representations were false and misleading.  by the end of 2023, go x had 
paid investors only about $1.45 million—less than half of the approximately $4 million in principal 
it raised from investors .  go x also failed to pay supposedly “guaranteed” refunds when investors 
requested them.  in addition, go x operated  a sharply unprofitable  business , putting unwitting 
investors at substantial risk.  
5. the poor performance of the go x investment led to multiple complaints from 
dissatisfied investors, yet defendants  continued to sell the investment with the same sales pitch.   
6. by engaging in the conduct described in this complaint, go x violated sections 
5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the securities act of 1933 (“securities act”)  [15 u.s.c. §§ 77e(a), 77e(c), 
and 77q(a )], and section 10(b) of the securities exchange act of 1934 (“exchange act ”) [15 
u.s.c. § 78j(b)]  and rule 10b- 5 thereunder  [17 c.f.r. § 240.10b- 5]; and debelov and salam 
violated  sections 5(a), 5(c), 17(a)(1) , and 17(a)(3) of the securities act  [15 u.s.c. §§ 77e(a), 
77e(c), 77q(a )(1), and 77q(a )(3)], and section 10(b) of the exchange  act [15 u.s.c. § 78j(b)]  and 
rule 10b- 5 thereunder  [17 c.f.r. § 240.10b- 5].   case 1:25-cv-23002-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 07/03/2025   page 2 of 20

 7. unless enjoined, defendants will continue to violate the federal securities laws.  
accordingly, the commission seeks injunctive relief and civil money penalties  against the 
defendants .  the commission also seeks disgorgement of ill- gotten gains with prejudgment 
interest against go x.  
ii. defendant s 
8. cheetah x inc. , which does business as “ go x,” is a delaware corporation  formed 
in june 2018.  go x operates its scooter rental business in florida, hawaii, and nevada  and sold  
its investment program to investors located across multiple states .     
9. alexander debelov , age 37, maintains residences in hallandale beach, florida and 
san francisco, california.  he is the founder of go x and has been its ceo since june 2018.  
debelov owns approximately 85 percent of go x’s stock and controlled go x during the relevant period. 
10. khodr salam , age 30, resides in sanford, florida.  he has been a go x employee 
since june 2018 and go x’s president of operations since approximately march 2021.  salam owns approximately two percent of go x’s stock.  
iii. jurisdiction and venue  
11. the court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to sections 20(b), 20(d), and 
22(a) of the securities act  [15 u.s.c. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d), and 77v(a) ] and sections 21(d), 21(e), and 
27 of the exchange act [15 u.s.c. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa].  
12. in connection with the conduct alleged in this complaint, defendants, directly or 
indirectly, singly or in concert  with others, made use of the means and instrumentalities of 
interstate commerce, the means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce, or of the mails .   case 1:25-cv-23002-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 07/03/2025   page 3 of 20

 13. this court has personal jurisdiction over the defendants and venue is proper in this 
district pursuant to section 22(a) of the securities act [15 u.s.c. § 77v(a)] and section 27(a) of 
the exchange act [15 u.s.c. § 78aa(a)]  because c ertain offers and sales of securities, acts, and 
transactions that form the basis for the violations alleged in this c omplaint occurred in this district.  
for example, during the relevant time, go x maintained an office in miami, florida which debelov has described as go x’s “headquarters” and debelov maintains a residence in this district.  additionally, at least six investors resided in this district w hen they invested.      
iv. factual allegations  
a. the go x business and securities offering  
14. go x offers scooters for rent to the public in markets located in u.s. cities  including 
honolulu, hawaii ; las vegas,  nevada; daytona beach, florida ; and other florida cities.  go x 
pays a portion of the rental fees  it collects  to its “partners,” which are the operators of the locations 
where the scooters are docked, typically retail stores and hotels in resort areas.   
15. from approximately july 2021 through november 2023, go x raised around $4 
million by offering and selling s ecurities to approximately 300 investors in multiple u.s. states.   
go x promoted its investment program through various means including content on its public 
website , which content was overseen and approved by debelov , and videos posted to youtube in 
which debelov appeared and spoke  as the company’s ceo .  debelov also personally promoted 
the go x investment program to prospective investors , including through email  and telephone 
conversations. 
16. when individuals expressed interest in the go x investment through the go x 
website, debelov provided salam with their contact information to follow up.  salam then reached out to the prospective investors by telephone, email, and/or text message.  salam described the case 1:25-cv-23002-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 07/03/2025   page 4 of 20  
 
 5  
 
 investment program to the prospects, including among other things, the expected rates  of return  
and that investors would receive monthly payments of their returns .  he also directed prospects to 
the go x videos on youtube.   
17. about half of the i nvestors signed written agreements  with go x to effect  their 
invest ments (“investor agreements”) .  debelov approved the form of the investor agreement s.  
using his ceo title, debelov  was also go x’s signatory on the investor agreements .  both debelov 
and salam provided investors with investor agreements  to sign, typically by emailing the investor 
a website link to an electronic copy of the agreement.   investors that were not provided investor 
agreements effectuated their investment by paying go x their principal investment amounts . 
18. investors typically paid between $2,000 and $30,000 for an  investment .  some 
made multiple investments.   investor funds were comingled in common bank accounts that go x 
used to pay its general  operati ng expenses .  
19. investors were passive and had a reasonable expectation of earning a profit or return 
which was derived entirely from the purported efforts and strategies of the defendants.  for 
example, the investor agreement s stated:  “go x will take care of all operations, provide the 
software solution, fix and deploy scooters at all partner locations.  go x will also retain a legal firm, pr firm and run online ads in order to increase the rentability of scooters. . . .  all of this will help the [investor] recoup and e arn . . . interest on their purchase in the most reasonable time 
frame.”   
20. echoing this language, salam sent emails and text messages to prospective and 
existing investors stating variously that:  (i) “investing in go x is an opportunity to earn passive income by owning a percentage of our fleet;” (ii) investors were “tapping into” go x’s “total revenu e” from all of its markets; and (iii) “ you don’t own 25 individual scooters; rather, you hold case 1:25-cv-23002-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 07/03/2025   page 5 of 20  
 
 6  
 
 a stake in the earnings generated collectively by 1,500 scooters across our hawaii and florida 
markets.”  debelov also emailed existing investors representing that the go x investment program 
offered “passive income.”   
21. indeed , go x made the essential managerial efforts that affected the success or 
failure of its  business  and the investment program .  this included, but was not limited to, launching 
operations in various markets ; marketing scooter s to consumers ; recruiting , contracting with, and 
paying the partners ; collecting scooter rental fees ; maintaining the scooters ; and handling 
permitting and other legal requirements of the cities where go x operated .   
b. the pitch to investors  
22. as defendants framed the go x program for investors —including in the investor 
agreements , on the go x website,  in the youtube videos, and in debelov ’s and salam’s direct  
communication s with investors —investors would receive a share of the gross profits that go x 
earned from  renting scooters .   
23. in promoting the go x investment program, defendants told investors to expect 
that this profit- sharing would provide investors with extraordinary returns in a short period of time 
with exceptionally low risk .   
24. for example, go x promoted the investment program with content on its public 
website that was overseen and approved by debelov.  at various times during the fraudulent 
offering, the website included the following claims : 
• “you make $ when someone rents a scooter from us .  we will 
share 50% of the gross profit”  (emphasis in original)  
• through such profit -sharing, an investor could “1.5x your money” in as little as “ 88 
days” case 1:25-cv-23002-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 07/03/2025   page 6 of 20  
 
 7  
 
 • “investors on go x platform earned” more than $3 million “in the last 
180 days”  
• a person who “in august 2021 . . . invested $20k into go x” would have achieved a “gain” of “+100%” by may 2022 
• the 100 percent gain “is just compared [sic] based on returns, but if you look at other attributes of this investment like risk -tolerance, liquidity and your ability to lose money, 
then go x stands in a completely different league (!) compared to all investments on the 
market”  
• unlike investors in the s&p 500, go x investors had “0 risk” and “[ no] . . . ability to 
lose money . . . *unless go x goes out of business”  
25. the promotion of the go x investment program also included videos posted to 
youtube in approximately october and november 2022.  in the se videos, debelov appeared and 
spoke over the caption “ceo, go x .”  he claimed that early investors had made returns of “i think 
it was 100 percent over twelve months” and that later investors were “getting a 50 percent return .”   
26. in a separate youtube video narrated by debelov and posted in approximately j une 
2022, debelov claimed that go x provided investors with “monthly cash flow.”     
27. debelov and salam also promoted the go x investment in their direct 
communications with investors .  for example : 
• salam typically had phone calls with prospective investors in which he described how the go x program worked, including the expected rate of return.   
• in or about january 2023, salam claimed in text messages  to a prospective investor that the 
go x “platform” was “completely sold out ” and had “limited availability  right now ,” but 
the prospect could invest a “max” of “$20k.”  salam also assured the prospect that he  could case 1:25-cv-23002-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 07/03/2025   page 7 of 20  
 
 8  
 
 reasonably expect a fifty percent return in one year and would receive monthly payments 
from go x.   
• in a phone call around the same time, the prospect expressed skepticism to salam that go 
x could provide such a return, and salam assured the prospect that go x could do so.   
• salam and debelov each sent prospective investors emails claiming that “our investors  
[had] made over  $3m on the platform .  as we calculated the average rate of return across 
all markets, it came out to an astonishing 87% annual return for a typical investor on 
[the] go x platform! ” (emphasis in original).  their emails also claimed  that the go x 
investment was “no -risk,” provided “monthly payouts ,” and “produces returns that are 4x 
of leading funds ,” and urged prospective investors to “see how it compares to other 
products on the market here:  https://goxapp.com/invest .”  
28. the investor agreements , which debelov and salam provided to investors, also 
touted the performance of the go x investment.  two iterations of the investor agreement were 
used, an original “1.0” version and a later “2.0” version.  the se variously included statements that 
1.0 investors could expect to “be paid” double their investment amount and expect to “earn that 
money anywhere between 3- 6 months”; that the “majority” of 1.0 investors had “doubled or were 
on track to double their funds within 6- 11 months of their initial investment”; that 2.0 investors 
“should expect to 1.5x their investment  within 6 -12 months”; and that 2.0 investors would “be paid 
monthly on their earnings .”   
29. the investor agreements  further stated that go x provided a “100% product 
guarantee” and would refund investments upon investor request.  consistent with this claim, in the june 2022 youtube video identified above, debelov said, “[i]f you’re not happy with your 
investment, you can request a refund and we’ll happily refund your money within that same day.”   case 1:25-cv-23002-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 07/03/2025   page 8 of 20  
 
 9  
 
 likewise, in february 2023, salam emailed a prospective investor a “welcome letter ” from 
debelov , which said:   “at any point , if you would like to get your money back, then just email me 
. . . and i’ll make sure you get it refunded to your card or wired within 24 hours.”      
c. defendants  violated the antifraud provisions of the exchange act and securities 
act 
30. defendants  knew , or were severely reckless  in not knowing, that the sales pitch to 
investors was false and misleading because it overstated past performance of the go x investment, 
overstated potential future performance of the investment, and understat ed investment risk.  
31. the claim that investors had “earned” more than $3 million “in the last 
180 days” suggested that the go x investment had performed well in the past and that it was 
likely to continue to do so in the future.  but the claim was false and misleading. 
32. the claim first appeared on the go x website no later than august 2022.  b y then , 
however, go x had only paid roughly $800,000 in returns to investors —far short of $3 million— 
according to its accounting records .  the claim was repeated on the website in december 2022  and 
in march, june, and september 2023.   
33. according to go x accounting records, during the relevant time, go x never 
returned $3 million to investors.  t hrough december 2023, go x paid only approximately 
$1.45 million in returns to investors ; in other words, go x had returned less than half of the 
approximately $4 million in principal  it raised from investors .  debelov knew , or was severely 
reckless  in not knowing, that the claim that go x investors had earned more than $3 million in 180 
days falsely  and misleadingly portrayed the go x investment’s past and expected future 
performance because he regularly reviewed go x accounting records show ing the amount of 
returns paid to investors.   debelov also knew , or was severely reckless  in not knowing, that the case 1:25-cv-23002-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 07/03/2025   page 9 of 20  
 
 10  
 
 extraordinary past and expected future performance of the go x investment touted elsewhere on 
the go x website, in the investor agreements, in the youtube videos, and in his emails to 
prospective investors , as described above, was likewise false and misleading.    
34. the sales pitch also falsely and misleadingly understated investment risk because 
go x lacked the financial strength to perform as the pitch told investors to expect .  as debelov 
knew , or was severely reckless  in not knowing, from his review of go x accounting records , go 
x’s scooter rental revenue during 2021 through 2023 totaled roughly $8.5  million —meaning it 
would take half of that revenue just to return the principal go x raised from investors .  from the 
same accounting records , debelov also knew , or was severely reckless  in not knowing, that go x 
recorded a negative net income in each of 2021, 2022, and 2023, with a cumulative recorded 
negative net income across the three years  of approximately $1 million.  these facts cast serious 
doubt on the company’s ability to return investor principal, let alone pay the touted extraordinary 
returns , and to guarantee refunds .  debelov therefore also knew, or was severely reckless in not 
knowing, that the “0 risk” claim and comparison to the s&p 500 on the go x website described 
above were false and misleading.  
35. investor complaints  received by debelov further show that  debelov knew , or was 
severely reckless  in not knowing, that the go x investment did not perform as represented in the 
investor sales  pitch .  from at least june 2022 to november 2023, debelov received multiple 
complaints from dissatisfied investors , including complaints about not receiving expected returns 
and unpaid refunds.  yet debelov and go x continued promoting the investment  to new investors  
using the same sales pitch containing misrepresentations about past performance, expected returns, 
and guaranteed refunds . case 1:25-cv-23002-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 07/03/2025   page 10 of 20  
 
 11  
 
 36. salam  also knew , or was severely reckless  in not knowing, that the go x sales pitch 
was false and misleading.  among other things, he monitored the go x website , which contained 
the past and expected future performance claims described above; he described the go x program 
to prospective investors, including the  expected rates  of return;  he provided investors with the 
investor agreement s, which included the claims of past and expected future performance as well 
as the refund guarantee  described above;  and he sent the emails to prospect ive investors  referenced 
above describing past performance  of the go x investment .  salam therefore knew , or was severely 
reckless in not knowing, that go x , a small scooter rental company,  implausibly offered investors 
the prospect of extraordinary  returns , guaranteed refunds , and less risk than investing in the s&p 
500.   
37. salam also learned of investor complaints , as shown by the following examples : 
• in june 2022, salam was copied on an investor’s email complaining to debelov where the 
investor stated :  “i’ve reached out a few times and i’m wondering what i need to do to start 
getting my monthly payouts. . . .  it’s been several months and i still have yet to get a single payout from my balance.”  the investor had invested in november 2021.  
• in august 2022, an investor complained to salam and debelov by email about not receiving 
monthly payments.  in february 2023, the investor complained again to salam by email, 
copying debelov, writing that he still was not receiving the payments.  salam replied to 
the investor that the investor  could expect a payment that week.  in march 2023, the 
investor emailed salam, copying debelov, noting that he did not receive the payment.  
• in october 2022, an investor complained by email to salam, stating:  “i am past my $5k 
payback and contract states that contract/agree [sic] make double your money which 
clearly i have not.”  case 1:25-cv-23002-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 07/03/2025   page 11 of 20  
 
 12  
 
 • in march 2023, an investor began complaining to salam and debelov in an email string 
about missing monthly payments.  later in the string , in june 2023, the investor wrote :  “i 
am having trouble with payouts again. . . . schedule [sic] payouts were never met.”  in 
august 2023, the investor wrote in the string that  he still was owed money.  he also wrote 
in an email to debelov :  “i’m starting to feel like i got scammed.”  
• in april 2023, an investor emailed salam and debelov that he and two other individuals 
who were “early investors” in go x had been receiving low payments or no payment in some months.  the investor also wrote:  “there has [sic] been constant inconsistencies with payment time frames . . . .  we are always having to reach out for our monthly deposits, asking several times for payment.  we are completely confused and lost as to what’s going on with our money and need clarification.”  
• in may 2023, an investor complained by email to salam and debelov that she had invested 
in november 2022, and based on the investment performance so far, “it will take years to 
make a profit , as opposed to the 10 months i was told.”  
• in june 2023, salam and debelov received a n email complaint from an investor stating that 
after approximately sixteen months, “i havent [sic] seen a return on my initial investment.”  
• in august 2023, an investor complained by email to salam and debelov that he had “asked 
kindly to withdraw my remaining $3,000 from my account for almost a year,” adding, “i am turning all of this over to my lawyer next week if i don’t hear back from you.”  
• also i n august 2023, an investor complained by email to salam and debelov that “[i]t has 
been almost 2 years with no [sic] even receiving my initial investment back which is laughable.”  the investor also asked that go x pay him his “remaining balance . . . or i will have no choice but to look at alternative options to get your attention.”  case 1:25-cv-23002-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 07/03/2025   page 12 of 20  
 
 13  
 
 • additionally in august 2023, an investor complained by email to salam, “i have not 
receive [sic] a payout”;  “i want to pull out everything” ; and “i will go to the proper 
authorities!”  
38. even after receiving these complaints, salam continued using the  false and  
misleading sales pitch to solicit investors.  in particular, after the august 2023 complaints, salam 
went on to sell investments tied to a new market go x was launching in las vegas.    
39. despite the investor complaints , and the implausible returns , purported low risk , 
and guaranteed refunds  touted in the go x sales pitch, salam never investigate d the truthfulness 
of the representations he  used to solicit investors .   
40. the false and misleading representations that defendants disseminated to investors 
in the sales pitch described above were material.  in making an investment decision, it would have been important for a reasonable investor to know, for example, that the purported past performance of the go x investment, including the repeated $3 million claim, was false; that go x failed to pay 
refunds upon request; and that go x was unprofitable.  
d. defendants violated federal securities registration provisions           
41. as stated above, go x, through debelov and salam, offered and sold approximately 
$4 million in securities  to approximately 300 investors  residing in multiple states.  in doing so, 
defendants used general solicitation, including a public website and youtube videos, and did not take reasonable steps to verify investors’ accredited investor status.  
42. contrary to the requirements of the federal securities laws, no registration statement 
was on file with the commission or in effect for any of these offers or sales, and no exemption from registration applied to the offers or the sales.   case 1:25-cv-23002-xxxx   document 1   entered on flsd docket 07/03/2025   page 13 of 20

complaint  
 plaintiff, the united states securities and exchange commission (the “commission”), 
alleges the following against defendant robynne alexander .  
preliminary statement  
1. between at least 2018 and 2024, robynne alexander (“alexander”) defrauded  
investors who purchased securities in various real estate investment projects. alexander raised a 
total of more than $4 million from at least 28 investors in connection with eight real estate 
investment projects.  alexander represented to her  investors that she would purchase, renovate, 
and sell properties for profit. however, she defrauded investors and misappropriated investor funds by using a substantial amount of investor money to pay fake investment returns to certain favored investors, to repay some investors and lenders in unrelated projects, and as her primary means of paying her personal expenses. she also falsely represented to investors, among other 
things, that she would provide regular updates on the projects, that she maintained accurate books and records concerning the projects, and that any investment returns provided to investors case 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 1 of 23  
2 
 
 would represent their share of  profits derived from the projects . none of these representations 
were true: she never notified investors when she disposed of a property or when it was 
foreclosed upon; she rarely provided updates to investors and when she did, it was only after repeated requests; she never kept accurate books and records; and some purported investment returns paid to investors were not derived from profits on the projects but were made by  taking 
money from some investors to pay off others. 
2. as a result of alexander’s  misrepresentations and deceptive conduct in 
connection with the offer and sale of the securities related to these real estate investment projects, investors have lost at least $3 million. 
violations  
3. as a result of the conduct alleged herein, alexander violated sections 17(a) (1)-(3) 
of the securities act of 1933 (the “securities act”) [15 u.s.c. §§ 77(e)(1)- (3)] and section 10(b) 
of the securities exchange act of 1934 (the “exchange act”) [15 u.s.c. §§ 78j(b)] and rule 10b-5(a)-(c) thereunder [17 c.f.r. §§ 240.10b- 5(a)-(c)].  
relief sought  
4. the commission seeks permanent injunctions against alexander, disgorgement of 
all ill-gotten gains from the unlawful conduct set forth in this complaint, together with prejudgment interest pursuant to section 20(b) of the securities act [15 u.s.c. § 77t(b)] and sections 21(d) (1),(5), and (7) of the exchange act [15 u.s.c. § 78u(d) (1),(5), and (7)], 
respectively ; civil penalties pursuant to section 20(d) of the securities act [15 u.s.c. § 77t(d)] 
and section 21(d)(3) of the exchange act [15 u.s.c. § 78u(d)(3)]; and an order pursuant to section 20(e) of the securities a ct [15 u.s.c. § 77t(e)] and section 21(d)(2) of the exchange act 
[15 u.s.c. § 78u(d)(2)] barring alexander from acting as an officer or director of any issuer that case 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 2 of 23  
3 
 
 has a class of securities registered pursuant to section 12 of the exchange act [15 u.s.c. § 78l] 
or that is required to file reports pursuant to section 15(d) of the exchange act [15 u.s.c. § 78o(d)].  
jurisdiction and venue  
5. the commission brings this action pursuant to sections 20 and 22 of the 
securities act [u.s.c. §§ 77t and 77v] and sections 21(d) and 27 of the exchange act [15 
u.s.c. §§ 78u(d) and 78 aa]. 
6. this court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 u.s.c. § 1331.  
alexander  has directly or indirectly made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate 
commerce, or of the mails  in connection with the acts, practices, transactions, and courses of 
business alleged in this complaint. 
7. venue in the district of new hampshire is proper under section 22(a) of the 
securities act [15 u.s.c. § 77v(a)] and section 27 of the exchange act [15 u.s.c. § 78aa] because the acts, practices, transactions , and courses of business constituting the alleged 
securities law violation(s) occurred in substantial part within new hampshire.

factual allegations  
raxx- lemay  
a. alexander misappropriated investor funds 
17. alexander was a real estate investment coach1 in 2018 when she began accepting 
investments for her first real estate investment project in new england – raxx- lemay , llc, 
later known as signature on elm , llc . between 2018 and 2021, alexander raised at least $2 
million from 18 investors by issuing membership interests2 in a nevada limited liability 
company named raxx -lemay  llc (“ raxx -lemay”). many of the raxx -lemay  investors first  
met alexander as their real estate investment coach.  
 
1 alexander was associated with a company  where she was paid to provide education on “foundational” real estate 
investing principles, personalized mentorship and advice, and connections in the real estate investing industry.  
2 a membership interest represents an ownership interest in a limited liability company. ownership and governance 
of limited liability companies (or “  llcs ”) typically uses different terminology than corporations, such as  members 
instead of shareholders, operating agreement instead of bylaws, and membership interests or units instead of shares 
of stock. an llc may assign different levels of voting and economic  rights to members by issuing different classes 
of membership interests.  https://www.sec.gov/resources -small -businesses/capital -raising -building- blocks/common-
startup -securities . case 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 5 of 23  
6 
 
 18. alexander provided to at least ten investors in the raxx- lemay project a six -page 
document titled “investment summary,” a 49- page document titled “private placement 
memorandum”  (the “raxx -lemay ppm”) , and a 66-page document titled “operating 
agreement” (the “raxx -lemay operating agreement”) .  
19. the raxx -lemay ppm  set forth the details of the investment. it stated that the 
project required a “minimum dollar amount” of $2 million to be raised by the later of may 15, 
2018, or the date by which the property was “no longer under contract .”3 if the minimum dollar 
amount was not raised i n that timeframe, raxx -lemay investors were to get their money back, 
with interest. according to public records,  alexander, in large part with funds from a hard money 
lender4 that received a mortgage on the property, purchased the property on july 27, 2018. 
therefore, the property was “no longer under contract” as of july 27, 2018. also as of july 27, 
2018, alexander had only raised a total of $7 00,000 for the raxx- lemay project. alexander , 
however, did not return any funds  to raxx- lemay investors  as required under  the raxx -lemay 
ppm.  
20. because alexander did not raise the minimum dollar amount by july 27, 2018, 
the date the property was “ no longer under contract,” she was  not entitled to use investor funds 
for any purpose, including collecting any management fees .  
21. despite having been obligated to return the raxx -lemay investors’ funds  as of 
july 27, 2018, alexander went on to use investor money for other purposes that were not 
 
3 the ppm includes this statement in the “summary of offering” section on page one and in the “executive 
summary on page six. however, section 2.5 of the ppm includes a statement that says, “[i]f the minimum dollar 
amount has not been raised by may 15, 2018 (or at such time as the property is no longer under contract, whichever 
comes first), the manager will not break impounds and all funds, including any interest earned thereon, will be returned to investors without deduction.”  alexander did not raise the minimum dollar amount by the prescribed 
deadline in either statement.  
4 a “hard money lender” refers to an individual or company (rather than a bank or conventional lender) that makes 
loans secured by real property, generally short -term bridge loans, primarily in real estate transactions. hard money 
loans generally have higher interest rates than more traditional financing options.  case 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 6 of 23  
7 
 
 permissible under the raxx- lemay ppm. section 2.7.1 of the raxx- lemay ppm states that the 
project “involves  the acquisition of two specific commercial buildings sharing a common party 
wall located at 121 1 & 1217 elm street, manchester , new hampshire 03101 (the property), for 
the purchase price of one million eight hundred thousand dollars ($1,800,000).”  the 
executive summary for the raxx- lemay ppm states that the “funds raised from this offering 
will be used to purchase, improve, operate, and ultimately dis pose of the property, to reimburse 
the manager for its acquisition costs, and to compensate the manager in the form of fees for 
making this investment opportunity available to investors.”  investor funds were thus only to be 
used to acquire and renovate the two properties identified in the raxx- lemay ppm.   
22. the raxx -lemay ppm includes further details about how investor funds would 
be used.  section 3 includes the following chart summarizing the sources and  uses of  investor 
proceeds :  case 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 7 of 23

23. section 5 also includes the below chart describ ing the manager’s fees or other 
compensation:

9 
 
  
24. as described above, alexander was not entitled to use any investor funds, having 
failed to meet the minimum dollar amount. she nevertheless used raxx- lemay investor funds 
for purposes other than those set forth in the raxx -lemay ppm. between july 2018 and 
november 2018, alexander used raxx -lemay  investor funds as collateral to draw  $1.3 million 
from a line of credit  held in the name of another entity she owned and controlled. in september 
and october 2018, alexander  then used a portion of the $1.3 million to pay back at least four  
investors in projects other than raxx -lemay, in an amount totaling approximately $282,000. 
alexander later used raxx -lemay investor  funds to repay the line  of credit .   
case 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 9 of 23  
10 
 
 25. in july 2021, alexander also used raxx -lemay  investor funds to make payments 
to two raxx- lemay investors totaling approximately $435,000. alexander also used  raxx -
lemay  investor funds to pay lenders and costs related to other real estate investment projects and  
to make loans to herself or other entities she co ntrolled  totaling at least $ 110,000.  
26. all told, alexander misused at least  $820,000 of raxx- lemay investor money for 
purposes that had nothing to do with acquiring and renovating the two properties. 
b. alexander failed to obtain investor approval for the transfer of the 
property  
 
27. in july 2021, alexander received a $600,000 investment in the raxx- lemay 
project from a company  controlled by two raxx-lemay investors (investors c and d) in 
exchange for 25% of the ownership of raxx- lemay. the company was also to perform the 
general contracting services for the raxx -lemay project. between july 2021 and february 2022, 
investors c and d learned that alexander had not filed raxx-lemay’s tax returns, that alexander 
failed to keep ordinary business records, that alexander was struggling to keep up with payments to raxx- lemay’s hard  money lender, and that alexander would not be able to finance the 
renovation of the raxx-lemay buildings.  
28. as a result of these discoveries, investors c and d sought to take control of the 
raxx -lemay project. to accomplish that, alexander agreed to give investors c and d an 81% 
interest  in signature on elm, llc (“signature on elm”) - an entity alexander created in july 
2021 - while retaining a  19% interest  for herself. alexander then transferred the real estate raxx -
lemay owned to signature on elm in february 2022. at the time of the transfer, investors c and d believed that alexander was the sole owner of raxx -lemay  because alexander never 
mentioned the other investors in raxx- lemay . signature on elm later  obtained traditional case 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 10 of 23  
11 
 
 commercial bank financing to pay off raxx- lemay’s  hard  money lender and associated fees, 
totaling roughly $2.8 million, as compensation for taking over the ownership of the property .  
29. alexander did not have the authority to transfer the property from raxx- lemay to 
signature on elm without the knowledge and consent of raxx- lemay investors. as a general 
matter, section 6.1 of the raxx- lemay operating agreement  gave alexander the authority to 
“manage all business and affairs of the company .”  but that authority was not unlimited, 
particularly with respect to the sale of the raxx -lemay property. specifically, section 14.1 of the 
raxx -lemay operating agreement states that the “the company shall be dissolved upon… the 
sale of the property (which will require the affirmative vote of a majority of interests).” in other 
words, a majority of the raxx- lemay investors would have had to approve the sale to signature 
on elm. not only did alexander violate this provision in the raxx -lemay o perating agreement, 
she kept the other raxx -lemay investors in the dark despite the fact that section 10.8 of the 
raxx -lemay ppm provides that  alexander  “intends to conduct periodic teleconferences and/or 
email updates with the members, as the manager deems necessary to keep them apprised about affairs involving the company.”   
30. despite the  clear terms of  the raxx -lemay operating agreement  and raxx -
lemay ppm , alexander  transferred the  raxx -lemay  real estate to signature on elm  without 
providing notice or obtaining the approval of a majority of the raxx- lemay  investors . as a 
result of the transfer, raxx -lemay , which did not have any interest in signature on elm, had no 
real estate holdings, a fact that was concealed from the other raxx -lemay investors whose 
investments then became worthless.  
 
 case 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 11 of 23  
12 
 
 c. alexander failed to provide required annual information packages to 
investors 
 
31. the raxx -lemay ppm states that  alexander, as the manager, will prepare an 
annual information package that …will include such things as an annual operations update, 
financial statements, k -1 forms5, and a copy of the company tax return, as applicable.” at least 
five raxx -lemay investors did not receive financial statements, k -1s, or regular updates, 
including after repeated written and oral requests to alexander regarding raxx- lemay .  
elm and baker  
32. alexander received the first investment to purchase and renovate a property 
located at 4 elm st. i n manchester, new hampshire from investor e on november 26, 2019, 
totaling $ 120,000. she deposited the money into a bank account for four on elm, llc (“four on 
elm”) .  
33. the certificate of formation for four on elm lists investor e as a member of the 
entity and the wire memo for investor e’s $120,000 investment states “real estate llc contribution.”  
34. on or about december 4, 2019, four on elm, through alexander, issued an 
investment for $ 140,000 to  investor f . the  investment security was documented in the form of a  
promissory note
6 that required a “lump sum repayment of $140,000.00 plus 12% per annum due 
on december 1, 2021 or sooner.” the note also states  that “[a]ll proceeds of the loans shall be 
 
5 a k-1 form is an irs form used by partnerships, s corporations, and estates and trusts  to declare the income, 
deductions, and credits that partners, shareholders, and beneficiaries have received in the tax year.   
6 the promissory note is a security. the proceeds of the note were intended to be used for developing 4 elm st. , the 
investor was motivated to make the investment for the expected profit from the high interest rate, the investor 
thought of the promissory note as a security, and there is no alternate regulatory scheme with oversight of the promissory note.  case 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 12 of 23  
13 
 
 used solely for the purposes more particularly provided for and limited by the the [sic] 
acquisition and construction build out of 4 elm street, manchester, nh.”  
35. on december 5, 2019, four on elm purchased the 4 elm st. property.  
36. approximately a year after receiving investments from investors e and f in four 
on elm, alexander formed a second entity , elm and baker, llc (“elm and baker”) , to accept 
additional investments related to the 4 elm st. property . alexander issued membership interests 
in elm and baker to two investors, investor g and investor h. each of those investors received 
an operating agreement governing the ir investments in elm and baker.  the operating agreements 
that investor g and investor h received contain differing terms despite both being in effect at the 
same time.  
37. investor g executed  a version of the elm and baker operating agreement 
(“investor g operating agreement”) on may 25, 2021 and invested $750,000 in elm and baker 
on may 27, 2021. the investor g o perating agreement states  that elm and baker will own the 4 
elm st. property by june 30, 2021 and that if it doesn’t , elm and baker will return investor g’s 
money along with 8% interest.  
38. although alexander controlled the 4 elm st. property through four on elm, she 
did not transfer the property to elm and baker until january 27, 2022, more than six months after 
she was  required  to under the investor g operating agreement. alexander did not return investor 
g’s money or the required interest.   
39. the investor g operating agreement includes a “principal purpose” section that  
states  that elm and baker’s “ sole purpose is to develop the property into an adaptive reuse 
conversion to apartments to be sold on the market ” and that investor g would have received her 
investment principal and 25% of the net sale profits  after the sale of the property.  case 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 13 of 23  
14 
 
 40. investor g understood, based on the investor g operating agreement and 
conversations with alexander , that the  investment would be used to renovate the 4 elm st. 
property. alexander  instead  used approximately $327,000 of investor g’s investment to repay 
investors e and f $260,000, plus $67,000 in purported return on investment  in june 2021. 
alexander also used approximately $210,000 of investor g’s  investment to pay investors 
unrelated to the 4 elm st. property in may and june of 2021. alexander thus misappropriated 
investor g’s money for purposes unrelated to acquiring and renovating the 4 elm st. property .  
41. investor h  executed the first version of the elm and baker operating agreement 
(the “investor h operating agreement”) on march 11, 2021. that same day, investor h wired the 
first of four investment installments  to alexander in the amount of $25,000. investor h wired t he 
final of the four installments  to alexander on october 22, 2021. the total amount of the four 
installments wired to alexander was $150,000.  
42. the investor h operating agreement includes a different “principal purpose” 
section from the investor g operating agreement. the investor h operating agreement simply states that “[elm  and baker’s] principal purpose shall be to purchase, lease and sell real estate. 
the llc may also pursue any other purpose permitted by law and approved by the managers.”  
however, based on statements made by  alexander, investor h understood that his investment 
would be used to renovate the 4 elm st. property.  
43. alexander used at least $50,000 of investor h’s investment  for project expenses 
unrelated to elm and  baker, numerous “loans” to herself or other business entities, and personal 
expenses such as grocery bills . each of these uses was an improper use of investor h’s money. 
44. despite her statements to investors, the property was never  developed, the project 
failed , and the property went into foreclosure in may 2023. case 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 14 of 23  
15 
 
 hb9g  
45. alexander formed hb9g, llc (“hb9g”) on january 17, 2020, purportedly to 
obtain investments to purchase, renovate, “stabilize,” and sell a multifamily property located at 9 
g st. in hampton, new hampshire. between january 16, 2020 and january 28, 2020, alexander 
received a total of $273,000 from three investors in exchange for membership interests in hb9g.  
46. all three investors received and executed the same version of the hb9g operating 
agreement. the hb9g operating agreement includes a “principal purpose” section that states 
that the “llc’s principal purpose shall be to purchase, lease and sell real estate.” based on 
statements made to them by  alexander, all three investors understood that alexander would only 
use the investment funds to purchase and improve the 9 g st. property. alexander also showed a 
private placement memorandum to at least one investor. t he private placement memorandum 
stated that alexander would renovate and sell the 9  g st. property to generate investment returns.  
47. despite these statements to investors, alexander improperly used approximately 
$50,000 of the $273,000 she raised for expenses related to other real estate investments and  
personal expenses  in february 2020.  
48. in response to frequent requests for updates from investors, alexander sent an 
email update to investors on april 3, 2023, more than three years after the initial investments. 
alexander told the investors that the property was in a “deteriorated state” and that it needed 
“approximately $100k in renovations to bring it where it needs to be for high- season rentals.” 
even though alexander told investors she would renovate and sell the property , the property was 
not renovated and went into foreclosure  in november 2023. investors were not notified of the 
foreclosure which rendered their investments worthless . case 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 15 of 23  
16 
 
 49. from the time alexander  received the investments in 2020 until she started 
providing updates in 2023, i nvestors continued to request updates and began threatening legal 
action. in response, alexander made promises of repayment  to the investors , including with 
returns on the initial investment.  however, because she no longer owned the property, she  would 
have to  use funds intended for a different project called legacy at laconia  to make any 
repayments to the hb9g investors. in an email to the  hb9g investors  on november 24, 2023, 
just 13 days after the property was foreclosed upon, alexander said she was “working with 
several lenders that are helping us with working capital to exit you as an investor. [lender a]  is 
providing us a $40m loan which will be used for the purchase of a large property (21.5m) up in 
the lakes area and the remaining funding is to be used for operating capital.”   that representation 
was false. alexander was not working with lenders relating to investors in hb9g. she was 
actually working with lenders to purchase a large property for a different project  that none of the 
hb9g investors were invested in.  
50. in another email on march 2, 2024. alexander told investors that she was “fully 
approved for a large institutional line of credit which was originally only for the purchase of the 
state property (laconia). it has since been expanded to include any real estate transaction meaning we can use the funds for any of my r eal estate projects – past or present.”  that 
representation was false. alexander had not been fully approved for a large institutional line of 
credit , nor was she ever approved for such.  
51. alexander never received a line of credit for the legacy at laconia project

 legacy at laconia 
52. alexander, on behalf of legacy at laconia, llc (“legacy at laconia”), signed a 
purchase agreement dated november 30, 2022 to purchase from the state of new hampshire a 
property known as the “state of new hampshire lakes region facility” – a 217- acre propert y in 
laconia, new hampshire (the “laconia property”) . the legacy at laconia project is described 
on “legacyatlaconia.com,” as a project to  “create a first in the world, innovative, world class 
resort implementing universal design with barrier free accessib ility within an all- in-one 
sustainable village.”  
53. alexander offered membership interests through a different entity called legacy 
at laconia fund llc  through the website , which would accept and pool investments to be used 
in the legacy at laconia project. the “investment details” tab of legacyatlaconia.com described 
a “secure & simple investment process” seeking $40 million for a  round a offering. in 
exchange for investments, investor s would receive units in legacy at laconia fund llc. 
alexander did not receive any investments in legacy at laconia fund llc . 
54. however, alexander received one investment of $250,000 in legacy at laconia  – 
the entity that entered into the purchase agreement for the laconia property -  from investor b on 
october 11, 2023. legacy at laconia documented the investment in the form of a  promissory 
note that would be payable, with all “simple, non- compounded accrued interest [at a] rate of 
15.00%” by february 15, 2024 – an approximate period of 4 months. the note was secured by a 
“collateral assignment of life insurance of [alexander’s] ” life insurance policy. investor b’s 
funds were wired to a legacy at laconia bank account in alexander’s control. like the 
promissory note alexander issued for four on elm, this note was a security. case 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 17 of 23

 55. despite investor b’s funds being given to legacy at laconia, alexander 
misappropriated at least $75,000 for payments related to other real estate investment projects, 
personal living expenses, and nearly $5,000 of personal travel expenses in  paris, barcelona, 
valencia, nassau, florida, and new orleans  in october and november 2023.  
56. to date, investor b has not received any repayment. because alexander could not 
secure financing to close the purchase of the laconia property, the s tate of new hampshire 
terminated the sale agreement on april 21, 2024. the property is now under agreement with another purchaser unrelated to alexander.  
other i nstances of alexander misappropriating investor f unds  
57. in addition to the four projects described above, between august 2019 and 
february 2024 alexander obtained a total of at least $360,000 from four investors in four other purported real estate projects . 
a. 9 cross st. somerville, massachusetts 
58. alexander received one investment for a total of $100,000 from investor b, who 
also invested in legacy at laconia. she deposited those funds into a bank account in the name of any property rehab llc (“any property rehab”), an entity alexander used to fund miscellaneous real estate investment projects. investor b’s funds were wired into any property rehab’s account on february 2, 2024 with a wire memo stating “for 9 cross st., somerville ma.” at the time investor b’s funds were deposited into any property rebab’s 
account, the account balance was $204.45.  
59. on february 5, 2024, alexander wired $81,579.00 to investor a, a raxx- lemay 
investor, from the same any property rehab bank account that held investor b’s investment case 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 18 of 23  
19 
 
 funds . alexander thus improperly used investor b’s investment funds to repay investor a the 
principal investment amount and purported return -on-investment for the raxx- lemay project .  
60. the property at 9 cross st. is being foreclosed upon and investor b has not been 
repaid.  
b. 23 country club rd. manchester, new hampshire 
61. on november 12, 2019, alexander received one investment for a total of $36,000 
for a project on 23 country club rd. in manchester, new hampshire. alexander documented the 
investment in the form of a promissory note that required a “lump sum payment in the amount of $36,000…plus $4,320 which represents 12% per annum due on december 1, 2020 or sooner – for a total amount due of $40,320.” the investor understood that when the property was sold, the repayment, including interest, would come out of the proceeds of the sale. like the promissory 
note alexander issued for four on elm, this note was a security.  
62. alexander sold the 23 country club rd. property in may 2020 for $120,000. 
despite having sold the property and telling the investor that repayment would come from the proceeds of the sale, alexander  used $77,000 of the money from the title company for the sale of 
the 23 country club rd. property to repay an investor in a different property – 37 c st. manchester, nh – on june 3, 2020.  
63. to date, alexander has only paid $4,500 of the total amount due under the 
investment to the investor in the 23 country club rd. property.  
haverhill, massachusetts project  
64. on june 8, 2022, alexander received one investment totaling $75,000 to purchase 
a property in haverhill, massachusetts. alexander was not able to secure a property transaction case 1:25-cv-00242     document 1     filed 06/26/25     page 19 of 23

unrelated portfolio of properties in rhode island.

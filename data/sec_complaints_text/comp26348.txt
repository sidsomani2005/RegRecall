summary  
1. this matter concerns insider trading by vakil and visen in the securities of kindred

elanco animal health, inc. (“ elanco ), had agreed to acquire all outstanding shares of kindred 
stock  for $ 9.25 per share in cash  (the “announcement”).   
2. vakil obtained material nonpublic information (“mnpi”) about elanco’s  
upcoming acquisition of kindred (“acquisition”) through her employment at elanco.  beginning 
on or about april 16, 2021, vakil took part in elanco’s due diligence relating to the acquisition.  case 7:25-cv-05697     document 1     filed 07/10/25     page 1 of 12  2 on may 12, 2021, in violation of her duties to elanco, vakil purchased kindred stock while 
aware of and based on that mnpi.  when kindred’s stock price rose by about  46% following the 
announcement, vakil obtained ill -gotten gains of $2,447.50. 
3. along with trading in kindred stock on the basis of the mnpi that she 
misappropriated from elanco, vakil also, in further violation of her duties to elanco, tipped her friend visen about the upcoming acquisition .  on june 15, 2021, the day before the 
announcement, visen used  the mnpi that he had obtained from vakil  to purchase kindred 
stock .  when kindred’s stock price rose by about  46% following the announcement, visen  
obtained ill -gotten gains of $109,437. 
violations  
4. through the above  conduct and as alleged further  here,  vakil and visen  have 
violated  section  10(b) of the securities exchange act of 1934 (“exchange act”) [15 u.s.c. 
§ 78j(b) ] and r ule 10b- 5 thereunder [17 c.f.r. § 240.10b- 5]. 
5. unless vakil and visen  are restrained and enjoined, they will engage in the acts, 
practices, transactions, and courses of business set forth in this complaint or in acts, practices, transactions, and courses of business of similar type and object.   
nature of the proceedings and relief sought  
6. the commission brings this action pursuant to the  authority conferred upon it by 
exchange act section s 21(d)  and 21a  [15 u.s.c. §§ 78u(d)  and 78u- 1].  
7. the comm ission seeks a final judgment: (a)  permanently enjoining vakil and 
visen  from violating the federal securities laws and rules this complaint alleges they have 
violated ; (b) ordering vakil and visen to disgorge all ill- gotten gains they  received because of

facts  
i. background  
a. elanco’s acquisition of kindred  
15. in or around april 2021, representatives of elanco  and kindred began discussing 
the possibility of a merger or similar transaction  between the two companies.   
16. on april 16, 2021, elanco submitted a non- binding offer to acquire kindred at a 
price between $8 and $10.50 per share in cash.  over the next several months, elanco performed 
due diligence in anticipation of an acquisition of kindred while representatives of elanco and 
kindred continued to negotiate the deal terms .   
17. by may 31, 2021, all other prospective bidders had discontinued negotiations 
with kindred, and most of the key terms (including the acquisition price per share) were agreed upon between kindred and elanco.  
18. the boards of directors of elanco and kindred approved the merger on june 14 
and june 15, 2021, respectively, and the acquisition was announced publicly on june 16, 2021.  case 7:25-cv-05697     document 1     filed 07/10/25     page 4 of 12  5 b. vakil’s role and obligations to elanco  
19. as senior director of product innovation at elanco, vakil served as part of a 
cross -functional team supporting new product development and pipeline investments, with a 
focus on evaluating risk, future revenue potential, and overall portfolio strategy.   
20. vakil was subject to elanco’s policies and procedures  regarding insider trading 
and treatment of mnpi obtained in connection with her employment.   
21. elanco’s insider trading policy expressly prohibited employees from trading on, 
or disclosing, confidential information obtained through their employment, including “trading in 
the securities of another company if you become aware of material, non- public i nformation about 
that company in the course of your position with [elanco].”  
22. before and during the relevant period, vakil participated in training course s on 
elanco’s code of conduct, including its insider trading policy.  she completed one  of those 
trainings in  or around may 2021, and the  written materials provided in connection with that 
training included these directives : “do not buy, sell, or trade elanco stock while in possession of 
important, nonpublic information about elanco … do not disclose important, nonpublic 
information about elanco  to others who may buy, sell, or trade  elanco  stock… [and] take the 
same trading and disclosure precautions for other publicly traded companies whose important, nonpublic information you may learn about in the course of your work at elanco (for example, companies with which elanco has a significant relationship, existing or proposed) ” 
(emphasis added).  case 7:25-cv-05697     document 1     filed 07/10/25     page 5 of 12  6 ii. vakil participated in elanco’s due diligence of kindred and obtained mnpi about 
the upcoming acquisition 
23. on april 16, 2021, the same day that elanco  submitted its first non -binding offer 
to acquire kindred, elanco assembled a cross -functional team to complete its due diligence on 
kindred.   
24. vakil was assigned to the due diligence team that same day to help assess the 
transaction from a product strategy and technical risk perspective.   
25. upon being assigned to the due diligence team, vakil was told that the due 
diligence related to a planned acquisition of kindred and that it was highly confidential .  
26. although elanco had assigned a code name to the potential acquisition  (“project 
knight”), internal emails – including emails vakil sent and/or received  in connection with her 
work on the due diligence team – used the name kindred interchangeably with the code name 
“knight .”   
27. for example, on april 16, 2021, vakil received an email from a senior business 
development manager and due diligence team  lead with the subject “knight – update,” which 
referred to kindred by name in the body of the email.   
28. on april 23, 2021, vakil sent an email to  a colleague in which she herself 
referred to the due diligence project as “knight (kindred).”   
29. on may 5, 2021, vakil participated in an email exchange with other members of 
the due diligence team in which she discussed product data that her team had received from kindred.   
30. many other  emails written or received by vakil between april 16 and may 12, 
2021 also referred to kindred by name as the subject of the due diligence.   case 7:25-cv-05697     document 1     filed 07/10/25     page 6 of 12  7 31. these communications also highlighted the confidential nature of the potential 
transaction . 
32. for example, certain emails written or received by vakil referred to project 
knight as “red company confidential information.”   under elanco’s  information handling 
policies, “r ed” was  the most restrictive designation, and was  reserved for information that 
“requires the most significant protective measures and procedures” because “loss, theft, 
unintentional disclosure or compromise could result in serious damage to elanco.”    
33. in addition, on at least one occasion, m embers of elanco’s business development 
team advised vakil  orally  that the prospective acquisition was confidential and sh ould not be 
disclosed to anyone . 
iii. vakil knowingly purchased kindred stock in violation of her duties to elanco  
34. on may 12, 2021, following an internal meeting in which the project knight due 
diligence team (including vakil) discussed their initial findings, vakil purchased 500 shares of 
kindred stock in her online brokerage account.   
35. vakil bought kindred stock because she believed the stock price would increase 
when the acquisition was announced.  
36. although she traded stocks periodically, vakil had not  traded  kindred securities. 
37. the announcement was made before the market open on june 16, 2021.  the 
price of kindred shares increased by about  46%  from the prior day’s  closing price of $6.34 per 
share to close at $9.23 per share.   
38. vakil sold all her kindred shares on june 16, 2021, obtaining ill- gotten gains of  
$2,447.50. case 7:25-cv-05697     document 1     filed 07/10/25     page 7 of 12  8 iv. vakil knowingly shared mnpi about the acquisition with visen in further 
violation of her duties to elanco, and visen unlawfully traded on it  
39. vakil and visen are long -time friends who grew up together in india.  they speak 
on the phone periodically and sometimes attend  social events together.  
40. for example, in february 2020, visen traveled from florida to new jersey to 
spend the weekend at a beach house with vakil and several other friends.  vakil picked visen up 
at newark airport while the other guests traveled separately.    
41. during 2021, vakil and visen communicated regularly via a n instant  messaging  
app and weekly videoconference calls, some of which included other friends whom they had 
grown up with. 
42. in or around may 2021, vakil disclosed to visen that kindred would soon be 
acquired by vakil’s employer, elanco, and that she thought kindred’s stock price would go up as a result.   
43. vakil mentioned the potential a cquisition two or three times in videoconference 
calls and instant message  conversations with visen during the month leading up to the 
announcement , including telling visen that she was working on a project to evaluate the 
proposed a cquisition of kindred for elanco’s leadership.   
44. in at least one conversation, vakil told visen that she had purchased kindred 
stock for her own account. 
45. on or about june 15, 2021, vakil advised visen that elanco’s acquisition of 
kindred would be announced in a day or two.   
46. vakil disclosed information about the impending acquisition to visen as an act of 
friendship, intending that her friend would trade on the information. case 7:25-cv-05697     document 1     filed 07/10/25     page 8 of 12  9 47. visen understood that information about the impending a cquisition was nonpublic 
and that vakil was not permitted to disclose it.  
48. on june 15, 2021, shortly after vakil informed him of the imminent 
announcement, visen – an infrequent trader who had never before traded kindred securities – 
purchased 38,000 shares of kindred stock in his  brokerage account.   
49. the next day, following the announcement, the price of kindred shares increased 
by about  46% from the prior day ’s closing price of $6.34 per share to close at $9.23 per share.  
as a result, visen generated  ill-gotten gains of $109,437.   
50. after the announcement , vakil asked  visen if he had purchased kindred stock 
based on their prior conversations, and when visen said that he had, vakil said “good for you. ” 
v. vakil lied to elanco and the fbi, and asked visen to lie to the fbi for her  
51. on or about september 21, 2021, for purposes of responding to a finra inquiry, 
elanco emailed a list of individuals who had traded kindred stock ahead of the announcement  to 
all elanco personnel who had been involved in the transaction, including vakil, asking if they 
knew anyone on the list.  visen’s name was on the list.   
52. vakil responded that she knew no one  on the list , and her false statement was 
incorporated into elanco’s response to finra.   
53. vakil later told visen about this email exchange with her employer, assuring 
visen that she had left his name out of her response.   
54. on december 21, 2023, t he fbi telephon ed vakil  and asked her  about her and 
visen’s kindred trading.   
55. during that conversation, vakil  first told  the fbi that she did not learn about the 
potential kindred a cquisition until after she had purchased kindred stock, although she later 
admitted that was untrue.   case 7:25-cv-05697     document 1     filed 07/10/25     page 9 of 12  10 56. vakil told the fbi that , while she could not recall specifically mentioning the 
planned a cquisition  to visen , it was possible that  she may have let it slip once as a result of job 
frustration , but not intending for visen to trade on it . 
57. the fbi concluded the interview by asking vakil if she would call visen and 
allow them to record the conversation.  she said she would consider it and suggested they speak 
again later that day.   
58. in the interim, vakil informed visen about law enforcement ’s plan to record the 
two of them talking.  vakil asked visen to corroborate her story that she only mentioned the planned acquisition to him once during a moment of job- related frustration, which was false.  
visen , however, declined to answer when vakil called him back with the fbi on the line.   
first claim for relief  
violation  of exchange act section 10(b) and rule 10b -5 thereunder 
59. the commission re -alleges and incorporates by reference here the allegations in 
paragraphs 1 through 58.  
60. vakil and visen , directly or indirectly, in connection with the purchase or sale of 
securities and by the use of means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or the mails, or the facilities of a national securities exchange, knowingly o r recklessly (i) employed one or more  
devices , schemes , or artifice s to defraud, (ii) made one or more untrue statements of a material 
fact or omitted to state one or more material fact s necessary in order to make the statements 
made, in light of the circumstances  under  which they were made, not misleading, and/ or (iii)

as a fraud or deceit upon other persons . case 7:25-cv-05697     document 1     filed 07/10/25     page 10 of 12  11 61. by reason of the foregoing, vakil and visen , directly or indirectly, violated and, 
unless enjoined, will again violate exchange act section 10(b) [15 u.s.c. § 78j(b)] and rule 
10b-5 thereunder [17 c.f.r. § 240.10b- 5].

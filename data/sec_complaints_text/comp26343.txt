summary 
1. nicholas palazzo defrauded more than tw o dozen investors and stole their money 
through two investment schemes.  a former harvard football player, palazzo often targeted former 
teammates as his victims.  but he also misappr opriated investme nts from others, including a navy 
veteran and a senior care coordinato r.  palazzo promised his victims that their investments would be 
used to fund his sports-related businesses.  instead, he spent the ove rwhelming majority of case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 1 of 39

10111213141516171819202122232425262728investors’ money on personal expens es such as rent for a multi-mil lion-dollar home, private school 
tuition, jewelry, and a disney v acation as well as on undisclosed de bts, litigation fees, and other 
expenses unrelated to the business ventures for which he had solicited the investments.  in total, of 
the roughly $3.1 million palazzo rais ed for two different purported  business ventures, he spent 
approximately $2.6 million on hims elf and unrelated expenses. 
2. palazzo is a 2003 graduate of harvard univer sity and a former football player.  to 
perpetrate his schemes, palazzo used his collegia te relationships and sports connections to build 
trust while at the same time ma king materially false a nd misleading statements  to investors about 
the businesses, including concer ning third-party financ ing, the use of invest or funds, and his 
compensation.  after obtaining mone y based on these false promises, palazzo then spent nearly all 
of it on himself and unrelated expenses. 
3. from at least october 2019 to december 2023 (the “relevant period”), palazzo and 
the sports-related corporate entities that he cr eated and led—4ta sports, play caller, and np 
ventures (together, the “cor porate defendants”)—fraudulently raised money from investors 
through securities offerings in which the investors r eceived various forms of notes and warrants.    
4. during the relevant period, palazzo raised i nvestor funds in two separate schemes: 
the stack scheme; and the play caller scheme.  in both schemes, palazzo targeted specific 
individuals, convinced these in dividuals to invest through mate rially misleading statements, 
misappropriated their funds, and th en subsequently approached ne w investors because he needed 
more investor money to con tinue to fund his lavish lifes tyle and pay his debts.  
5. first, in the stack scheme, betwee n at least october 2019 and march 2020, 
palazzo raised $900,000 from three i nvestors by offering and selling secured promissory notes and 
warrants through 4ta sports.  during this offering, he  represented to all thr ee investors that their 
investments would be used to repu rchase the assets of stack medi a, inc. (“stack”).  stack is 
a sports media company that palazzo founded in 2 005, largely sold in 2017, and was trying to then 
repurchase.  he further represented to all three inve stors that he either had or would shortly secure 
$5 million in third-party funding.  n one of this was true.  instead, shortly after receiving investor 
funds, he immediately spent the money to pay un disclosed debts, litigation fees, and personal case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 2 of 39

10111213141516171819202122232425262728expenses, including his children’s private school tu ition and personal rent.  also, palazzo knew, or 
was reckless or negligent in not knowing, that he  had not secured or woul d not shortly secure $5 
million in third-party funding.  
6. second, in the play caller scheme, betw een at least september 2020 and december 
2023, palazzo raised approximately $2.1 million from at least 22 i nvestors by offering and selling 
convertible promissory notes thr ough play caller and its majority owner, np ventures.  palazzo 
represented that investor funds would be used to develop and imm inently launch the play caller 
sports-betting application.  once ag ain, this was not true.  instea d, palazzo misappropriated more 
than 75 percent of investor funds  to (a) pay personal expenses, including vacations to disneyland 
and hilton head island, south carolina, (b) sett le an unrelated lawsuit, and (c) pay himself 
exorbitant consulting fees.   
7. as a result of the alleged conduct, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions 
of section 17(a) of the securities act, 15 u.s.c.  §77q(a), and section 10(b) of the exchange act, 
15 u.s.c. §78j(b), and rule 10b-5 thereunder, 17 c.f.r. § 240.10b-5.  palazzo is also liable as a 
control person for the corporate defendants’ violat ions of section 10(b) of the exchange act and 
rule 10b-5 thereunder pursuant to s ection 20(a) of the exchange act. 
8. the sec seeks a judgment from the court, as set forth in more precise detail in the 
prayer for relief: (i) permanently enjoining th e defendants from violati ng securities act section 
17(a) [15 u.s.c. §77q(a)], and exchange act sect ion 10(b) [15 u.s.c. §7 8j(b)], and rule 10b-5 
thereunder [17 c.f.r. § 240.10b-5]; (ii) perman ently enjoining palazzo, including through any 
entity owned or controlled by pal azzo, from participating in the issuan ce, purchase, offer, or sale of 
any security (other than securi ties for his own persona l account); (iii) directing the defendants to 
disgorge all ill-gotten gains they  received as a result of the ac ts and/or courses of conduct 
complained of, plus prejudgment in terest thereon; (iv) directing the defendants to pay civil money 
penalties; (v) barring palazzo from serving as an officer or director of a public company; and (vi) 
granting such other relief as this court may de termine to be just, e quitable, and necessary. case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 3 of 39

factual allegations 
a. palazzo’s past lawsuits and business problems motivated his fraud.  
25. one of palazzo’s key motivations for perpetrating two fraudu lent schemes and 
misappropriating millions of dollars in investor funds were the laws uits against him and associated 
legal and settlement expenses that he incurred.  as outlined below, these difficulties are relevant because they demonstrate palazzo’s motive and scient er in connection with the fraudulent schemes.  case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 6 of 39

10111213141516171819202122232425262728indeed, from 2015 through 2020, palazzo accumulated a significant amount of debt related to 
several businesses, was involved in several laws uits, and was terminated from his job.  palazzo 
raised funds from investors by te lling them it was for business purposes; however, he used a 
significant amount of the invest or funds to pay the debts a nd expenses described below. 
26. in 2005, palazzo founded stack, a youth sports media company.  over time, 
stack had a number of investors and creditors that it owed m oney to.  by may 2017, stack had 
more than $18.6 million in outstanding liabilities.  
27. in mid-2017, palazzo sold substantially all of stack’s assets to spay for $9.5 
million.  after selling stack, palazzo joined spay as  its chief digital officer.  during this time, 
palazzo faced mounting difficultie s because he failed to fully re pay some of stack’s investors 
and creditors and also concealed from spay some of stack’s liabilities,  as set forth below: 
a. between 2017 and 2019, and while he was st ill employed as spay’s chief digital 
officer, palazzo failed to fully repay all of  stack’s investors a nd creditors after the 
spay sale, resulting in at least two lawsu its by stack investors against palazzo and 
his companies for fraud and breach of contract. 
b. palazzo also concealed from spay the extent of stack’s debts to entity a.  entity 
a was stack’s largest customer and th eir substantial monetary relationship 
required both stack and entity a to make payments to and receive payments from 
each other.  subsequently, entity a went into receivership in april 2019.  then, 
from approximately june 2019 to early november 2019, palazzo concealed from 
spay the fact that entity a’s receiver  was demanding money from spay.  indeed, 
until early november 2019, spay’s understanding was that entity a owed stack millions of dollars.  palazzo admitted in testimony during the sec’s investigation of 
these events that he attempted to reso lve these demands by wiring $250,000 to entity 
a’s receiver in october 2019 without spa y’s knowledge.  then, in november 2019, 
entity a’s receiver contacted spay directly, claiming that spay owed entity a more 
than $4 million.  spay terminated palazzo’s  employment in april 2020.  and in july case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 7 of 39

the nature of entity a’s relationshi p and misappropriating spay’s funds. 
c. additionally, in 2015, palazzo, on behalf of st ack, entered into an agreement with 
marketing firm b, a sports management  company, whereby stack would solicit 
sponsorships and advertising for marketing firm b.  under the agreement, stack 
received a $300,000 advance and was requi red to generate a minimum of $600,000 
in revenue.  according to individual e, one of market ing firm b’s owners, stack 
did not generate the required revenue and wa s required to repay the advance, plus the 
revenue shortfall.  palazzo testified that he  made repayments to marketing firm b at 
least through 2019 and 2020.  spay was not aware of this agreement or debt. 
28. separately, by on or around october 4, 2019, palazzo and a palazzo-controlled entity 
were sued for fraud, breach of contract, and other legal violations related to a $1 million transaction 
that occurred in july 2019.  this lawsuit (the “2019 civil lawsuit”) was unrelated to spay or the 
corporate defendants. 
b. palazzo and 4ta sports fraudulently ra ised at least $900,000 from investors 
by misrepresenting that the funds would be used to repurchase stack. 1. overview of the stack scheme.
 
29. by 2019, palazzo became unhappy with his 2017 sale of stack and began 
negotiating with spay to repurch ase some of stack’s assets.  (palazzo often referred to 
repurchasing stack’s assets as simply repurchasing stack, and for simplicity this complaint 
refers to it the same way.)  pa lazzo formed 4ta sports to se rve as the company that would 
repurchase stack and is the sole  shareholder of 4ta sports.  
30. between october 2019 and march 2020, palazzo  and 4ta sports raised at least 
$900,000 from three investors for the stack repurchas e.  palazzo first a pproached two former 
harvard football teammates (“inve stor 1” and “investor 2”) in oc tober 2019.  he explained to each 
of them that he would use their investment to repurchase stack.  he convinced both to invest 
after representing that he had already secure d a $5 million funding comm itment and presenting a 
purported funding agreement signed by individual e on behalf of consulting company c.  the case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 8 of 39

10111213141516171819202122232425262728funding agreement purported that 4ta sports pr omised to pay consulting company c $5 million 
with interest “for value received.”  palazzo further represented that consulting company c was a “family office,” a term used to refer to a private wealth management office  established by an ultra-
high-net worth family, which lent  an air of credibility, sophis tication, and secu rity to the 
investment.  palazzo’s statements to investors 1 and 2 were false.  not only had palazzo not secured 
$5 million in funding, but also, shortly after re ceiving $250,000 from each investor, palazzo began 
using the money on debts and legal and personal e xpenses unrelated to th e repurchase of stack. 
31. after palazzo had misappropr iated almost all the $500,000 from investors 1 and 2, 
he sought out a new victim.  in and around march 2020, he spoke with his ne xt victim (“investor 
3”), who owned a youth sports training center.  he convinced investor 3 to invest $400,000, again 
claiming he had secured a $5 mi llion funding commitment and pres enting a different purported $5 
million funding agreement between  4ta sports and media company d.  the funding agreement 
purported that 4ta sports woul d receive $5 million in funding in march 2020.  palazzo also 
assured investor 3 that her funds would be used to repurchase stac k.  none of this was true.  
indeed, shortly after receiving investor 3’s funds, palazzo used the funds for personal expenses and 
for legal debts and fees unrela ted to repurchasing stack.  
32. palazzo never used investor funds for e xpenses associated with an attempt to 
repurchase stack.  to the contrary, palazzo used at least 90% of the funds  on unrelated debts and 
litigation expenses, as well as pe rsonal expenses such as priv ate school tuition and vacations.  
ultimately, palazzo never repurchased stack.  th e specific details of palazzo’s stack scheme 
are described below. 
2. palazzo and 4ta sports defrauded two former harvard football 
players through a securities offering.  
33. in october 2019, palazzo reached out to investors 1 and 2 seeking $250,000 from 
each of them.  he explained to bo th investors that he intended to use their funds for the repurchase 
of stack.    case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 9 of 39

34. during the investment process, palazzo both spoke with his friend and former 
teammate investor 1 and sent him emails.  pal azzo, as 4ta sports’ sole officer, proposed an 
investment opportunity to his fr iend.  in return for investor  1 committing $250,000, 4ta sports and 
palazzo offered to provide investor 1 with th e following: (1) a $250,000 secured promissory note 
with a maturity date just two w eeks after the deal (oct ober 31, 2019) with a 6% interest rate and a 
preferred return of 10% ($25k), (2 ) a warrant to purchase to 6 2,500 shares in 4ta sports at $.01, 
(3) a security agreement granting investor 1 a secu rity interest in and lie n on 4ta sports’ assets, 
and (4) a pledge agreement granting investor 1 a firs t priority security intere st in all of palazzo’s 
4ta sports stock. 
35. in an october 10, 2019 email to investor 1, palazzo explained th at he was at the 
“finish line” in his repurchase of stack.  he fu rther explained that he was “about $250k short in 
the interim for these working capital true-ups, wh ich i hadn’t planned to address until post-closing 
as is the traditional treatment.”  in this same ema il, palazzo claimed that “i have the full financing 
committed ($5m) by a family office in texas who is al so an investor in [redacted], which is one of 
the top trainers in the nation and an  original advisory board member of stack.”  in response to this 
email, investor 1 expressed that he would like to help, but that he wanted  to speak, in part, to 
understand the risk associated with  the investment.  in a follow- up email, palazzo then provided 
investor 1 a copy of a convertible  promissory note between 4ta sports and consulting company c 
(the purported family office), dated septem ber 23, 2019, which supposedly documented consulting 
company c’s agreement to prov ide $5 million to 4ta sports.  
36. after speaking with palazzo and accepting hi s representations, i nvestor 1 signed the 
warrant agreement and security ag reement.  palazzo executed these same documents, as well as the 
promissory note and pledge agreement, as th e chairman of 4ta sports.  after receiving 
instructions from palazzo, investor 1 then wired $250,000 on october 15, 2019, to a bank account 
associated with one of pal azzo’s other entities.    case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 10 of 39

37. during this same period, palazzo also reach ed out to investor 2 to secure $250,000 in 
funds, again offering a promissory note, 4ta sports  warrants, a security agreement, and a pledge 
agreement in return.  in emai ls dated between october 10 and 11, 2019, palazzo presented investor 
2 with the same deal terms proposed to investor 1.  palazzo represented that the funds would be 
used to “clean up some of the working capital fro m the acquisition from 2017 to now and for me to 
repay approximately $250k of capital that they funded into stack before the deal closes.”  palazzo 
further represented that: “i have  the financing and deal documen tation completed to close on the 
acquisition of the stack assets as soon as the family office can fund, which is expected to be next 
week, but could possibly slip into  the following week.”  in respons e to questions from investor 2, 
palazzo doubled down and stated the “family offi ce is fully committed” a nd “they have committed 
to fund me with the $5m regardless  as to if i buy the stack assets  back.”  palazzo also provided a 
copy of a convertible promissory  note between 4ta sports and consulting company c, dated 
september 23, 2019, which supposedly documented consulting company c’s agreement to provide $5 million to 4ta sports. 
38. after palazzo’s representati ons to investor 2, invest or 2 signed the security 
agreement and warrant agreement on october 11,  2019.  palazzo executed these same documents, 
as well as the promissory note and pledge agreement, as the chairm an of 4ta sports.  investor 2 
then wired $250,000 on october 15, 2019 to a 4ta sports bank account. 
39. palazzo’s transactions with investors 1 and 2 constituted an offer and sale of 
securities.  indeed, the warrants on their face warn the holder, in part, that they are securities subject 
to certain transfer restricti ons under the federal securities la ws.  additionally, the secured 
promissory notes were interest -bearing notes that ar e defined as securities under the federal

investors 1 and 2 invested money and expected to receive profits from palazzo’s efforts in 
connection with 4ta sports and stack.    
c. palazzo’s statements to investors 1 and 2 were false.   
40. palazzo and 4ta sports’ statements to investors 1 and 2 concerning the use of 
investor funds and the $5 million in secured funding were material ly false and misleading.  palazzo 
had no intention of using the funds to “clean up” working capital or ot herwise fund the stack 
acquisition.  palazzo also knew, or  was reckless or negligent in not knowing, that he (1) had not 
secured $5 million in funds for the stack repurchase and (2) as presented, the $5 million 
promissory note was misleading. 
41. first, as stated above, both investor s wired $250,000 to palazzo-controlled bank 
accounts on october 15, 2019, after palazzo represented that the funds would be used for “working 
capital” issues related to the stack repurchase.  however, that very same day, palazzo wired the 
$250,000 he received from investor 1 to try to re solve the demand from entity a’s receiver.  this 
payment had nothing to do with “working capital true-ups” or re purchasing stack.  to the 
contrary, at that time spay had no knowledge of any possible debt owed by stack to entity a, 
nor had palazzo informed spay of any negotiations w ith or payments made to entity a’s receiver.  
thus, palazzo did not use investor 1’s f unds to secure the stack repurchase.  
42. then, between october 18, 2019 and february  27, 2020, palazzo used approximately 
$95,000 from investor 2 to repay debts owed to market ing firm b, which are expenses that predate 
spay’s acquisition of stack, and were unknown to spay.  thus, there is no legitimate reason why 
palazzo needed to make this payment prior to closing on the stack repurchase.  palazzo then 
spent another approximately $25,000 from investor 2 to pay his lawy ers in the 2019 civil lawsuit.  
palazzo then transferred approximately $130,000 of inve stor 2’s funds to a palazzo-controlled bank 
account held in the name of np vent llc (“np vent”), an account  he primarily uses for personal 
expenses.  for example, palazzo transferred $9,000 of investor 2’s funds to np vent on or around 
november 5, 2019, and then immediately used  these funds to pa y his personal rent. case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 12 of 39

1011121314151617181920212223242526272843. palazzo’s immediate misappropriation of inve stor funds demonstrates that he had no 
intention of using the investment s to pursue the stack repurchase.  further, palazzo’s statements 
that he would use the funds to repurchase stac k were materially misleading because a reasonable 
investor would have wanted to know that palazzo intended to use investor funds for debts, 
litigation, and personal expe nses, rather than the stated busine ss purpose.  indeed, investor 1 has 
stated that his funds being used to stave off li tigation would have been important information for 
him to know when deciding to invest because he woul d have considered the investment riskier.  he 
further stated that he would have been unlikely to  invest had he known that his funds would be used 
for this purpose.  
44. second, palazzo knew, or was reckless or ne gligent in not knowing, that he and 4ta 
sports had not secured $5 million in financing fo r the stack repurchase.  palazzo represented to 
investors 1 and 2 that the $5 million was “committed” by a “fam ily office,” which investor 1 
understood to mean a privately he ld wealth management firm of  a high-net-worth family or group 
of individuals.  palazzo then sent each invest or a copy of a $5 million promissory note between 
4ta sports and consulting company c.  taken t ogether, palazzo’s representations about the $5 
million funding commitment from c onsulting company c portrayed the investment to investor 1 as 
something that was sophisticated, had attracted interest from high-net-wo rth individuals, and was 
secured by funds from those hi gh-net-worth individuals.  in  truth it was anything but. 
45. for example, palazzo knew that consulting company c was not a family office but 
rather a consulting business run by individual e, a nd palazzo also knew or was reckless or negligent 
in not knowing that consulting company c lacked any realistic ability to provide $5 million in 
funding.  for example, palazzo knew that consulting company c was not even providing this funding; at best the funding (if it ever came at all) would come from another source or sources 
(potentially media company d) and would be routed  through consulting company c.  palazzo also 
knew that those other sources had not yet provide d any of those funds to consulting company c. 
and palazzo also knew that one of those poten tial funding sources, media company d, was the 
same source palazzo had been trying (and failing)  to get funding from for about a month.  palazzo 
also knew that individual e, the signatory on the $5 million promissory note , had separately been case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 13 of 39

10111213141516171819202122232425262728trying (and failing) for several months to help pa lazzo raise $1 million to help resolve the claims 
that resulted in the 2019 civil lawsuit, in which both he and individual e were defendants.  taken 
together, palazzo knew, or was reckless or neglig ent in not knowing, that his written and oral 
representations to investors 1 and 2 that he ha d the $5 million in financing and that it was fully 
committed, as represented by the $5 million promissory note, were misleading.  further, these 
statements were materially misl eading because a reasonable investor would have wanted to know 
that guaranteed funding had not been secured because it rendered their investment riskier.  indeed, 
investor 1 indicated that the ex istence of $5 million in committe d financing was important to his 
assessment of the riskiness of the investment. 
46. at a minimum, palazzo misled investors 1 and 2 by representing that he had $5 
million in funding while omitting in formation necessary to make that statement not misleading, 
including that the funders of consulting company c had not yet provided the funds. 
d. palazzo’s deceptive “lulling” statements to investor 1.  
47. both investors 1 and 2 were to be repaid  with interest on october 31, 2019, a mere 
two weeks after providing the funds.  knowing he would not repay the inve stors on time (because 
he had already stolen most of th e investors’ money), palazzo began engaging in “lulling” statements 
to investor 1 a day before repayment was due, when  he assured investor 1 that he was “definitely 
closing everything this week.”  then, on or around november 11, 2019, palazzo told investor 1: 
“all signs point to this week getting the funds back to you.”  on or around december 24, 2019, 
palazzo told investor 1: “expecting to close on or before 12/31.”  on or around february 12, 2020, 
palazzo told investor 1: “i expect  that we’ll close things out by the end of the month and be able to 
do the payback soon after.”  appr oximately three months later,  on or around may 29, 2020, palazzo 
told investor 1: “funds are supposed to be here on monday and then closing.”  then, on or around 
june 16, 2020, palazzo told investor 1: “no funds yet but they are promising by end of this week.”  
finally, approximately 10 months after i nvestor 1’s $250,000 wire, on or around august 28, 2020, 
palazzo told investor 1: “i expect some real move ment/negotiation on the deal to happen in the next 
week or so.” case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 14 of 39

1011121314151617181920212223242526272848. investor 1, who was concerne d, also asked palazzo for updates on several occasions.  
on or around november 15, 2019, investor 1 asked pa lazzo if there was “any risk of running out of 
$$ while you are working to close.”  palazzo resp onded: “hey, no risk there, all good on the cash 
flow at the moment.”  then, on or around january 13, 2020, investor 1 asked palazzo: “is cash flow 
okay in the meantime?”  palazzo re sponded: “cash flow is good right  now so no worries there.”   
49. palazzo knew all of these lulling statements  were false because he had already sent 
investor 1’s funds to entity a’s r eceiver.  he therefore knew that he had no intention of using the 
money to close the deal with stack. 
50. these lulling statements were designed to  prevent investor 1 from taking any action 
to report palazzo’s conduct, which enabled palazzo to continue defrauding other investors in both 
the stack and play caller schemes. 
51. to this date, palazzo has not repurchased  stack.  palazzo has also not repaid 
investors 1 and 2 any of the principal or interest due on their promissory notes. 
3. palazzo defrauded the owner of a youth sports training center. 
52. after misappropriating almost all of inve stor 1 and 2’s funds, palazzo pitched the 
stack investment to his next  victim (“investor 3”) via telephone in and around march 2020.  
palazzo was introduced to investor 3 through indi vidual e, who had a mutual connection in the 
sports industry.  during this peri od, investor 3 and her family were in the process of building a 
youth sports training center.   
53. after being introduced, palazzo made materia lly misleading statements to investor 3 
like those made to investors 1 and 2 to secure an investment.  during these discussions, individual 
e both arranged and was present for phone calls between investor 3 and palazzo and forwarded 
emails from palazzo to investor 3.  in these discussions, palazzo expl ained to investor 3 that he was 
attempting to repurchase stack a nd that he needed to come up with a down payment and the 
remaining funds to finalize the re purchase.  he also explained th at investor 3’s $400,000 investment 
would act as a “bridge loan” unt il he shortly received the $5 million in funding that media 
company d had already committed to provide.  pa lazzo assured investor 3 that her investment 
would be secured by a $5 million credit placement agreement that 4ta sports had with media case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 15 of 39

promote her training center with  professional athletes.   
54. according to investor 3, she came aw ay from her discussions with palazzo 
understanding that her money woul d be used to repurchase stac k, her investment would be 
secured by the credit placement ag reement, and stack wo uld promote her trai ning center.  based 
on this understanding, investor 3 ag reed to make the investment.  palazzo subsequently signed a 
promissory note memorializing the investment, which he asked indivi dual e to send to investor 3. 
55. investor 3’s understanding is confirmed by the deal documentation, which palazzo 
signed as 4ta sports’ chairman and ceo.  the investment package provided to investor 3 
included a promissory note and a $5 million cred it placement agreement from media company d, 
which purported to secure the inve stment.  under the terms of the promissory note, investor 3 was 
entitled to 5% interest on her investment.  the pr incipal and interest on the note were to be paid 
approximately one month later on april 3, 2020.  the credit placement agreement was between 
media company d and 4ta sports, signed by palazzo  as the chairman and ceo and dated january 
6, 2020.  the version of the agreement sent to in vestor 3 stated that media company d’s funds 
would be delivered in march 2020.   
56. after accepting palazzo’s representations, investor 3 ultimately wired $400,000 to a 
4ta sports bank account on and around march 6, 2020.  
57. like the promissory notes and warrant ag reements 4ta sports entered into with 
investors 1 and 2, this promissory no te is a security, either in the form of a note or an investment 
contract.    
a. palazzo intentionally deceived investor 3. 
58. palazzo and 4ta sports’ statements to i nvestor 3 concerning the use of her funds 
and the $5 million in secured f unding were materia lly false and misleading.  palazzo had no 
intention of using the funds to repurchase stac k.  further, palazzo knew, or was reckless or 
negligent in not knowing, that (1) he had not secured $5 million in  funds for the stack repurchase 
and (2) as presented, the $5 million credit  placement agreement was misleading. case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 16 of 39

1011121314151617181920212223242526272859. palazzo never intended to use investor 3’s funds to repurchase stack.  as stated 
above, investor 3 wired the $400,000 on march 6, 2020, believing the funds would be used for the 
stack repurchase.  however, that very same day, palazzo began a series of transfers that 
eventually totaled $68,000 to the np vent account, wh ich he primarily used fo r personal expenses.  
moreover, beginning that very same  day and continuing into later th at month, palazzo wired a total 
of $75,000 he received from investor 3 to repay his de bt to marketing firm b.  palazzo also wired 
$15,000 to pay his lawyers in the 2019 civil lawsuit.   palazzo’s use of in vestor 3’s funds for 
personal expenses, legal expenses, and an unrelated lawsuit are misappropriation.   
60. then, on april 8—after investor 3’s pro missory note was due for payment—palazzo 
wired $180,000 through three stack bank accounts that he controlled before ultimately wiring the 
money to spay on the same day.  palazzo testified that this payment was a necessary part of the 
repurchase process.  but, according to an spay repr esentative, spay’s controller periodically asked 
if palazzo’s stack unit was generating cash and, if so, to direct it to be sent to the parent 
company.  moreover, spay described the purpose of  this $180,000 payment in a balance sheet entry 
as “a net cash payment and reduce old stack receivable .”  thus, palazzo sent this payment to spay 
pursuant to stack’s normal operating agreements and to lead spay to believe that stack was 
generating cash.  further, during this period, spa y and palazzo were not in active negotiations 
because spay had paused the negotiations to investigate palazzo’s knowledge of stack’s 
purported debts to entity a.  and, indeed, spay fire d palazzo two days after this payment transfer.  
thus, this payment had nothing to do with repurchasing stack.   
61. palazzo’s immediate misappropriation of inve stor 3’s funds shows that he never had 
any intention of using her investment to pursue the stack repurchase.  further, his statements 
were materially misleading because  a reasonable investor would ha ve wanted to know that palazzo 
intended to use investor funds fo r stack’s debts and palazzo’s pers onal and legal ex penses; rather 
than, the stated business purpose.  indeed, investor 3 has stated that  she would not have invested if 
she knew that palazzo was going to use the funds for pers onal expenses.  
62. moreover, palazzo’s misappropriation here comes after he had already 
misappropriated nearly $500,000 raised from other inve stors.  his previous misappropriation of case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 17 of 39

did so knowing that he planned to use the funds for his personal benefit and not to advance the 
stack repurchase.  
63. palazzo knew, or was reckless or negligent in not knowing, that he and 4ta sports 
had provided a credit placement agreement to invest or 3, which would never be funded.  according 
to the agreement, 4ta sports was supposed to receive the $5 million fro m media company d in 
march 2020.  in reality, palazzo had entered into an identical credit placement agreement with 
media company d in september 2019 and was suppos ed to receive the funds  that month.  media 
company d never provided the funds.  yet, after months of not receiving the $5 million, palazzo 
asked media company d’s managing director to sign a new agreemen t in january 2020, stating: “i 
can’t show the old agreement to my funding source.  i need something recent .”  palazzo asked the 
managing director to sign yet another new version in  in late february 2020 a nd a follow-up letter in 
early march, prompting palazzo to  send an email stating: “hopeful ly this helps us get something 
closed!”  these emails demonstrate that palazzo knew, or was reckless or negligent in not knowing, 
that the $5 million credit placement ag reement was simply a ruse to obtain money from investor 3, 
and that there was never any true  intention of the credit placem ent agreement actually funding.  
indeed, the credit placement agreement that pa lazzo provided to investor 3 never funded.   
64. taken together, palazzo knew that his repr esentations to inve stor 3 about the $5 
million credit placement agreement were false.  further, these statements were materially 
misleading because a reasonable investor would ha ve wanted to know that the collateral for the 
promissory note had not been secure d because it rendered their investment riskier.  indeed, investor 
3 has stated that she ultimately invested because  the credit placement agreem ent convinced her that 
her investment was safe. 
65. palazzo has not repaid investor 3 any of  the principal or interest due on her 
promissory note.  when contacted by investor 3, pa lazzo continues to claim that he does not have 
the funds to repay her.  palazzo has never informed  investor 3 that he spent her investment on debts 
and personal and legal expenses.   case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 18 of 39

$900,000 to repurchase stack through promissory notes  between 4ta sports and investors 1, 2, 
and 3.  during this same period, 4ta sports had no source of funds other than this $900,000.

promissory notes described above that supposedly convert the funds  owed to the investors into 
equity in yet another palazzo business venture.  investor 1 received a similar solicitation from 
palazzo but has not signed an amendment to his agreements with palazzo and 4ta sports.  when 
soliciting investor 1 to sign these amendments, palazzo omitted any reference to how he had 
previously used investor 1’s funds .  that omission rendered materi ally misleading statements that 
palazzo made to investor 1 in the new solicit ation, including that the new business was “an 
opportunity to reorganize and am end your current outstanding 4ta sports note to facilitate 
repayment and provide appropriate  collateral.”  based on the doc uments the sec has presently 
obtained regarding the solicitations of investors 2 and 3, it appears that pa lazzo similarly omitted 
his misappropriation of funds when  recently soliciting them, which rendered similar statements to 
them materially misleadi ng.  the sec is continuing to assess these new developments.  however, 
palazzo’s misleading efforts to have  investors sign amendments to their prior agreements, including 
representations that these amendmen ts are a way for investors to obt ain repayment, are part of his

operating company that supports new companies crea ted by him, including play caller.  at all 
relevant times, palazzo was the ceo and majority  shareholder of np ventures; np ventures was 
the majority shareholder of play caller; and palazzo served as ceo of play caller.  play caller case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 20 of 39

70. after forming np ventures and play ca ller, palazzo commenced the play caller 
scheme in september 2020.  from september 2020 until december 2023, palazzo raised more than 
$2.1 million from at least 22 investors through play  caller and np ventures, representing that 
investor funds would be used to develop and la unch the play caller m obile application through 
which players could bet on the next  play in a live sports game (t he “play caller app”).  instead, 
however, palazzo misappropriated more than 75 per cent of these investor funds to pay undisclosed 
debts, litigation fees, personal expenses, including vacations to disneyland and hilton head island, 
south carolina, and consulti ng fees to himself.   
71. the $2.1 million raised consisted of appr oximately $1 million in np ventures 
investments from 5 investors a nd approximately $1.1 million in play caller investments from 
approximately 17 investors.  all but one investor’s inve stments were memoria lized in convertible 
promissory notes with np ventur es or play caller.  one conver tible promissory note purported to 
pay 15% interest; the rest pur ported to pay 6% interest.

detailed below.   
a. palazzo and play caller defrauded a group of eight investors—twice. 
i. the first fraudulent offering to  the dallas investor group. 
74. on or around november 11, 2020, palazzo pitched a group of eight dallas-area 
investors (the “dallas investor group”) on a play caller investme nt through an in-person meeting 
and presentation.  according to a member of the dallas investor  group (“investor 4”), palazzo 
represented to the group that thei r investment funds would be us ed to pay software engineers 
working on the play caller app.  he also represen ted that the play caller app would be launching 
in january 2021, just in time  for the nfl playoffs.   
75. further, palazzo’s presentation included a slide titled “use of funds.”  that slide 
stated that a $500,000 investment wo uld allow play caller to (1) “s ecure key data, engineering and 
management talent”; (2) “execute against [strat egic distribution] partne rship to bring api to 
sportsbook market”; and (3) “dev elop first ‘free to play’ game  in partnership with major

per month and sent a spreadsheet indicating that his salary would represent a relatively small 
portion of play caller’s overall expenses. 
76. after this meeting, in december 2020, th e members of the dallas investor group 
collectively invested $50 0,000 in the play caller offering.  ea ch investor’s investment was 
memorialized in a convertible pr omissory note with play caller  and had a maturity date of 
december 28, 2022.  
77. after obtaining the dallas investor group’s funds in december 2020, palazzo 
wasted no time in putting them to his personal use.  indeed, that month, palazzo used approximately 
$19,000 of the funds to pay legal fees related to  the 2019 civil lawsuit.  then, in january 2021, 
palazzo spent $235,000 of the $500,000 investment to settle the 2019 civil lawsuit.  further, 
between december 2020 and march 2021, palazzo spen t approximately $54,000 to repay part of his 
outstanding debt to marketing fi rm b.  palazzo also used approximately $21,000 of the dallas

investor group to the np vent account, which he primarily used for person al expenses.  palazzo 
had exhausted the entire $500,000 investment by around april 6, 2021.  in total, palazzo and play 
caller spent less than ten percent of the dallas investor group’s f unds on play caller’s software 
engineers and other devel opment personnel.     
78. thus, despite palazzo’s representations that  his salary would represent a relatively 
small portion of play caller’s ove rall expenses, he subsequently spent approximately 80% of the 
dallas investor group’s funds for hi s personal use, as shown in the chart below.  during the period 
from december 2020 through march 2021, play caller had no source of funds other than the 
$500,000 from the dallas investment group.  for purposes  of this chart, “per sonal use” includes the 
consulting fees that operated as palazzo’s salary, other personal expenses, and debts and litigation 
expenses unrelated to play caller.

1011121314151617181920212223242526272881. for instance, on or around november 8, 2022, investor 4 emailed palazzo ahead of 
the notes’ maturity date of december 28, 2022.  inve stor 4 asked palazzo fo r the play caller app’s 
status and play caller’s balance sheets and income statements.   
82. palazzo responded the next day, attaching in come statements and a balance sheet.  
the income statements showed that play caller had $50,966 in tota l expenses in each month of 
2021, with $37,781 spent on “product, technology & te am expenses,” $2,000 spent on “software & 
application expenses,” and $11,175 on “other product & dev expenses.”  the balance sheet showed 
that play caller had $10,409 in cash and cash equivalents in oc tober 2021 and $158,224 in cash and 
cash equivalents as of december 2021.  these statements were false. 
83. for example, the statement that play  caller spent only $50,966 in january 2021 was 
false.  play caller spent $235,000 on the 2019 civil lawsuit alone in january 2021, and also had 
other expenses.  the statement that play caller spent only $50,966 in july 2021 was similarly false.  
in july 2021, palazzo had used another play ca ller investor’s funds to  pay more than $60,000 in 
rent and a security depos it for a multi-million-do llar home, currently valu ed at over $5 million, for 
him and his family. 
84. additionally, play caller did not have cash and cash equivalents of $10,409 in 
october 2021 and $158,224 in december 2021.  accord ing to play caller’s bank records, in 
october 2021, the company had a beginning balance of $10 in its  bank account and an ending 
balance of $30.  in december 2021, the compa ny had a beginning bala nce of $18.25 in its bank 
account and an ending balance of $19.25.  the co mpany had similarly lo w funds from september 
through december 2021. 
85. as the sole signatory to the play caller  bank account, palazzo had full control and 
knew play caller’s expenditures and cash on hand.  his bald-faced falsities were an attempt to 
cover up his misappropriation of funds. 
86. palazzo’s deception resulted in six of th e investors agreeing to roll their notes 
forward another year while the ot her two investors rolled their not es forward to february 2023.  all 
eight extensions were memorialized in amended promissory notes executed by palazzo, acting on case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 24 of 39

principal or interest due on thei r convertible promissory notes. 
b. palazzo defrauded a former professional athlete.  
88. having exhausted the dallas investor gr oup’s funds, palazzo moved on to new 
targets of opportunity.  on or around june 8, 2021, palazzo sent a play caller presentation to a 
former professional athlete and an  employee at a venture capital firm  affiliated with the athlete.  
approximately one month later, on or around july 16, 2021, palazzo received a $100,000 
investment in play caller from the venture capital firm (“investor 5”).  this investment was 
memorialized in a convertible pr omissory note with play caller  and had a maturity date of 
december 2022. 
89. in the presentation, palazzo represented th at play caller was “raising capital to 
execute against specific product de velopment targets for the next 12 months to bring its proprietary 
engine and games to market through strategic partnerships .”  this was not true.  
90. to the contrary, the very day that palazzo  and play caller received investor 5’s 
funds, palazzo began transferring money from the pl ay caller bank account to np ventures’ bank 
account.  then, of the $85,000 in funds transferred to np ventures between july 16, 2021, and july 
27, 2021, palazzo spent more than $60,000 on a security deposit and the first three months’ rent for 
his family’s new multi-million-dol lar rental home.  he spent another $8,000 on moving expenses 
and $5,000 on litigation expenses unrelated to play  caller.  palazzo tran sferred the remaining 
approximately $13,000 of investor 5’s money from  a play caller bank acc ount to the np vent 
account.  of those funds, palazzo spent approxim ately $9,000 on rent for his previous rental home 
and $1,200 on credit card payments.   
91. in total, palazzo spent less than $2,500 of  investor 5’s money on business expenses 
of play caller.  palazzo has not  repaid investor 5 any of the principal or interest due on its

92. palazzo’s misappropriation of investor funds continued unabated.  on or around 
february 28, 2022, palazzo sent a manager of a gaming industry advisory  firm a play caller 
presentation.  a few weeks later, on or around ma rch 17, 2022, the gaming industry advisory firm 
(“investor 6”) invested $100,000 in play caller.  investor 6’s investment was memorialized in a 
convertible promissory note w ith play caller and had a matu rity date of february 2023. 
93. in the presentation, palazzo represented that  play caller “plans to raise capital to 
execute specific product developm ent goals, including integration of  web3 elements, to bring its 
platform to market generating revenues through licensing and real -money competitions.”  once 
again, this was not true.  instead, palazzo again misappropriated investor funds to subsidize his 
lifestyle.  
94. indeed, shortly after receiving investor 6’s funds, in apr il 2022, palazzo spent 
approximately $10,000 at the mandalay bay resort  & casino in las vegas and approximately 
$4,200 on airfare.  between march 17 and april 26, 2022, he transferred more  than $60,000 to the 
np ventures account.  he used those funds to spend $12,250 on personal rent, more than $5,000 on 
his children’s private school and daycare, and more than $20,000 on other personal expenses, 
including car payments, dental e xpenses, and purchases at a pool  supply store.  he withdrew 
another approximately $4,200 in cash and transferred at least $8,800 to the np vent account, 
which he used primarily for personal expenses.  
95. in total, palazzo spent less than $20,000 of investor 6’s money on play caller’s 
business expenses.  palazzo has not  repaid investor 6 any of the principal or interest due on its 
convertible promissory note.

with np ventures and had maturity dates between december 6, 2021, and october 31, 2023.   case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 26 of 39

continued development of play caller.  documents provided to investor 7, in cluding a presentation 
that palazzo sent investor 7, i ndicate that palazzo solicited mone y from investor 7 by referencing 
both play caller and stack.  for example, in  or around august 2020, palazzo sent investor 7 a 
document which states: “np [ventu res] plans to raise $500,000 ($500k) in seed capital to launch.  
funds will be used to launch the play caller/4ta sports businesses and support the buyback of certain assets of stack media, my previous co mpany, that are highly syne rgistic.”  investor 7 
subsequently began investing with pal azzo, sending him $100,000 on december 7, 2020, and 
ultimately investing approximately $500,000 th rough a dozen notes between december 2020 and 
september 2023.  though investor 7 may have invested in bot h the play caller and stack 
opportunities, palazzo used little of  investor 7’s funds on either inve stment.  to the contrary, of the 
$500,000, palazzo misappropriated at least $450,000 by, for instance, using the funds to pay for 
multiple vacations, including a trip to disn eyland.  for instance, on or around june 22, 2022, 
investor 7 made a $100,000 investme nt.  starting the next day, a nd continuing to around june 27, 
2022, palazzo spent approximately $4,000 during a pers onal trip to lake tahoe.  palazzo spent at 
least $5,000 on another personal trip to hilton head island in late july 2022.  additionally, palazzo 
used investor 7’s funds for various other person al expenses, including personal rent, car payments, 
credit card payments, dental expenses, sports and fitness expenses, his children’s daycare and 
private school expenses, and si gnificant cash withdrawals.  
98. moreover, throughout 2023, palazzo made severa l “lulling” statements to investor 7 
that were designed to both give i nvestor 7 a false sense of security  and operated as new frauds that 
convinced investor 7 to i nvest additional funds.   
99. for instance, on or around april 20, 2023, palazzo wrote to investor 7: “finally, and 
please know that i am embarrassed to ask and bo ther you, but i wondered gi ven the timing of the

until he convinced investor 7 to provide him with another $25,000 on or around may 25, 2023.    
100. between april and august 2023, palazzo contin ued this same pattern of “lulling” 
statements followed by new fraudulent requests for additional investme nts.  each time, investor 7 
provided palazzo and np ventures with more fund s in exchange for a new promissory note signed 
by palazzo on behalf of np ventures. 
101. in total, palazzo and np ventures spen t less than $55,000 of investor 7’s funds on 
business expenses.  palazzo has not  repaid investor 7 any of the principal or interest due on his 
convertible promissory notes.  on information and be lief, investor 7 still tr usts palazzo and despite 
the efforts of the sec staff to reach out to him, investor 7 is unaware that  he has been defrauded. 
e. palazzo defrauded a senior care coordinator. 
102. after years of misleading investors and mis appropriating funds, palazzo’s scheme 
was still continuing in late 2023—even after palazz o became aware of the sec’s investigation.  on 
or around september 28, 2023, palazzo or ally represented to a senior  care coordinator that her 
investment would be used to ma rket the launch of play caller.   on or around september 28, 2023, 
palazzo received a $100,000 investment from an en tity (“investor 8”) th at the senior care 
coordinator formed with a realtor.  this investment was memori alized in a convertible promissory 
note with play caller and has a ma turity date of september 21, 2024. 
103. palazzo did not use investor 8’s funds for ma rketing play caller.  indeed, play caller 
did not even launch a version of the app until after palazzo exhausted investor 8’s funds.  instead, palazzo spent approximately $46,400 at a san fr ancisco jeweler, another $9,500 on personal rent, 
approximately $5,000 on airfare, and more than $ 9,000 on other personal expenses, including a trip 
to hilton head island.   
104. in total, palazzo and play caller spent le ss than $14,000 of investor 8’s funds on any 
business expenses.  palazzo has not  repaid investor 8 any of the principal or interest due on its

several of the play caller investor s listed above have stated that they would not have invested if 
they knew their funds would be used  for palazzo’s personal expenses. 
3. palazzo misappropriated play caller investor funds.  
106. between september 2020 and december 2023, palazzo received approximately $2.1 
million to develop his play caller business, primarily through convert ible promissory notes between 
investors and play caller or np ventures.  play caller and np ventures received a limited amount 
of non-investor funds during that time, includ ing consulting income earned by palazzo and 
palazzo’s own funds.  play caller received approximately $125,000 from non-investor sources, while np ventures received approximate ly $157,000 from non-investor sources.   
107. a breakdown of how palazzo spent the combined play caller and np ventures 
investors’ funds appears below.  for purposes of this chart, to the extent play caller and np

10111213141516171819202122232425262728109. because he was the person both making th e statements above and misappropriating 
investor funds, palazzo knew, or was reckless or negligent in not knowing, that his statements to 
investors were materially  false and misleading.  he also knew, or was reckless or negligent in not 
knowing, that his misappropr iation of funds acted, or would act , as a fraud or deceit upon these 
same investors.  because palazzo was the ceo a nd controlling shareholder of both play caller and 
np ventures, and acted on behalf of play caller and/or  np ventures when signing the promissory 
notes discussed above, his scienter and negligence is imputed to play caller and np ventures.  
additionally, because palazzo managed both play ca ller and np ventures on a day-to-day basis, 
negotiated the promissory notes at issue, and co ntrolled the financial e xpenditures for both play 
caller and np ventures throughout this period, he is  a control person within the meaning of section 
20(a) of the exchange act. 
4. palazzo attempted to paper over his fraud through his substantial 
consulting payments and loans to himself.  
110. as palazzo kicked off the play call er offering, in or around september 2020, 
palazzo entered into separate consulting agreemen ts with play caller and np ventures.  each 
agreement was structured to pay entities co ntrolled by palazzo $20,000 per month in purported 
“consulting fees” (through np vent or np ventures).  palazzo, as the chairman and ceo of each 
entity, is the lone signatory on each agreement.  the terms of these agreements provided entities 
controlled by palazzo total annual consu lting fees of $480,000.  between 2020 and 2023, palazzo 
transferred approximately $1 million in investor  funds to himself (t hrough np vent or np 
ventures) pursuant to these agreements, which he used primarily for personal expenses, legal 
settlements, and litigation expenses.  in c ontrast, palazzo spent le ss than $350,000 on developing 
the play caller app.  palazzo did not disclose the consulting agreements nor the extent of his 
“compensation” to investors excep t for the misleading disclosure s to the dallas investor group 
described above in paragraphs 74-75, 77-79, and the misleading disclosu re to investor 6 and others 
discussed in paragraph 113 below.  
111. on top of consulting fees, palazzo also pa id personal expenses and unrelated debts 
and litigation expenses directly out of play caller and np ve ntures’ bank accounts.  indeed, case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 30 of 39

10111213141516171819202122232425262728palazzo testified that he paid his personal e xpenses out of these bank accounts and that, on a 
monthly basis, he performed a reconciliation allo cating each personal expense as either: (1) expense 
reimbursement, (2) consulting fees, or (3) loans to  himself.  at the end of each year, palazzo 
papered over his theft of investor funds by executi ng a note for the amount he  had “loaned” himself 
during the year.  as of january 2024, there we re four outstanding not es:  a $170,000 note for 2020, 
a $145,000 note for 2021, a $210,000 note for 2022, and a $184,000 note for 2023, for a total of $709,000.  each note has a five-year term, and palazzo has not made any payments of principal or 
interest under the notes back to the companies.   again, palazzo has acknowledged that he never 
revealed these “loans” to his investors.  
112. even if palazzo was entitled to some sala ry or consulting fees  for his efforts, 
omitting that he was going to spend more than 80% of investor funds on his salary, personal 
expenses, unrelated legal settlements, and unrelat ed legal expenses and a mere 20% of investor 
funds on engineering and other deve lopment expenses rendered the st atements he made about using 
investor funds to develop the play caller app mate rially misleading.  furthe r, in pitch decks to 
several investors, including to investor 5, he made specific repr esentations that the money would 
not only be used to build the play caller app, but th at it would be used to ex ecute against a list of 
specific product development targets.  however,  palazzo spent nearly all of investor 5’s $100,000 
investment on consulting fees to entities he controlled, more than  75% of which ultimately went 
toward palazzo’s personal rent, security de posit, and moving expenses.  thus, palazzo’s 
representations to investor 5 were false and misleading.   
113. additionally, in pitch decks to investor 6 and two othe r investors not individually 
discussed in this complaint, palazzo disclosed projected payroll relate d expenses, along with 
projections for millions in reve nue, profits, operating income, and expenses.  all these projections 
were built on the premise that play caller w ould be an operating company with revenue and 
expenses.  however, from may 22, 2020 to dece mber 31, 2023, play caller had no significant 
source of income or revenue—virtually  all of its funds appeared to be  investor funds or funds from 
palazzo or palazzo-affiliated entities.  thus, palazzo  omitting to tell investor 6 and other investors 
that he intended to use approximately 80% of their investment on person al and other non-business case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 31 of 39

development expenses rendered hi s disclosures concerning payroll related expenses materially 
misleading.  
114. nor can palazzo claim that his consulting f ees were reasonable, and investors should 
have contemplated that he woul d need a salary.  to the contra ry, palazzo’s representations to 
investors through, for instance, payroll projections that he provided in his pitch decks clearly 
contemplated an operating business, with a growing payroll, devoted to deve loping the play caller 
app, and not a founder using the overwhelming majo rity of investor money as his own personal 
slush fund, which he then used to  bankroll his living expenses.  
115. for example, the pitch deck that palazzo drafted and provided to  the dallas investor 
group prior to their $500,000 investment disclosed that palazzo would receive a $250,000 salary in 
2021, representing approximately 5% of play caller’s planned expenditures for that year.  however, 
nowhere in the slide deck or ot her communications did palazzo disclose that he would use their 
investment to settle a civil lawsuit, pay outsta nding debts, and on other personal expenses.  in any 
event, he spent approximately $530,000—inc luding approximately $400,000 from the dallas 
investor group—on non-business expenses in 2021, wh ich was not only well in excess of palazzo’s 
disclosed $250,000 salary but represented over 75% pe rcent of play caller’s actual expenses for 
2021.  
116. given palazzo’s repeated stat ements to investors that th eir funds would be used to 
develop the play caller app, his use of $1.7 million on himself or  to pay debts and litigation 
expenses unrelated to play ca ller, and less than $350,000 on devel oping play caller, rendered his 
statements materially false and misleading.  the consulti ng agreements and loans were not 
legitimate payments for business ope rations, but a cover-up and part of  palazzo’s overall deliberate 
scheme to steal investor funds. 
117. the sec has recently received information that  within the past three months palazzo 
may have sought to re-victimize numerous np ve ntures and play caller investors by soliciting 
them to sign amendments to th e notes described above in excha nge for equity in np ventures, 
and/or play caller warrants.  as  with the 4ta sports amendments  discussed above, the documents case 5:24-cv-06602   document 1   filed 09/20/24   page 32 of 39

when soliciting these amendments, and that o mission rendered materially misleading palazzo’s 
statements to the investors such as “i will also be personally guaranteeing any outstanding 
promissory notes in np ventures. it is important that i do all i can to help each investor earn a 
strong return, while also providing additional secu rity for the notes, espe cially because we had 
hoped to pay them back already.”  as with the recent solic itations of the 4ta sports investors, the 
sec is continuing to assess these new developments .  however, palazzo’s misleading efforts to 
have investors sign amendments to their prior agreements, including representations that these 
amendments are a way for investors to obtain repa yment, are part of his scheme to conceal from 
them his intentional misappr opriation of their funds. 
118. in total, across both the stack scheme  and the play caller scheme, palazzo, 
through the corporate defendants, received appr oximately $3,065,000 in investor funds between 
october 2019 and december 2023.  palazzo has spen t more than $1 million on consulting fees to 
himself.  he has spent another $1.1 million on unrela ted past business debts and litigation expenses 
and $400,000 on personal expenses beyond the consulting fe es to himself.  this misappropriation of 
investor funds, combined with how palazzo often misappropriated investor funds immediately after 
receiving them, demonstrates that these schemes were not legitimate businesses that failed, but 
intentional schemes by which palazzo sought to de fraud people, including his friends, in order to 
enrich himself.

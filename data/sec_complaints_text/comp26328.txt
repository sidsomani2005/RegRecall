complaint  
1. between 2019 and 2024, defendants peter scalise iii (“scalise”) and 
the3rdbevco inc. (“the3rdbevco”  or the “company” ), a beverage company that scalise 
founded, controls, and operates, perpetrated a $3.6 million  offering fraud.  
2. defendants misled investors about the use of the  invest or funds  and a potential 
collaboration with “individual 1,” a celebrity described by defendants as a “global superstar 
and music icon.”   
3. contrary to what investors were told, scalise misappropriated and misused more 
than $856,000 of investor funds , including for personal expenses, such as tuition, mortgage  
payments , and landscaping.     
4. in addition, in communications to existing  investors and potential investors, 
defendants promoted a potential collaboration with individual 1 on a supposed rum alcohol product, using individual 1’s nickname and trademark in its product brand name  and us ing 
individual 1’s name, image, trademark, and music  in various promotional materials —all without 
authorization.  while defendants communicated  with individual 1’s brother about an case 2:25-cv-03088-wb     document 1     filed 06/17/25     page 1 of 18  
2 
 arrangement  in which he would agree to attempt to facilitate a  meeting between defendants and 
individual 1’s management team , there was never any deal , negotiation, discussion or any other 
contact between the defendants and  individual 1 or individual 1’s  management team.  
5. moreover, defendants also offered and sold unregistered securities without a  
valid  exemption from registration.  
6. by engaging in the conduct described in this complaint, defendants violated, 
directly or indirectly, and unless enjoined will continue to violate, sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) 
of the securities act of 1933 (“securities act”) [15 u.s.c. §§ 77e(a), 77e(c), and 77q(a)] and section 10(b) of the securities exchange act of 1934 (“exchange act”) [15 u.s.c. § 78j(b)] and rule 10b- 5 thereunder [17 c.f.r. § 240.10b- 5].

 defendants  
10. peter scalise iii , age 56, resides in  suffolk county, new york.  he founded, 
operates, and controls  the3rdbevco .  he is the company’s  largest shareholder, and 
simultaneously serves as its chief executive officer, president, principal accounting and 
financial officer, and sole member of the board of directors.  
11. the3rdbevco inc. is a new york -based corporation and a penny stock issuer.  in 
october 2019, the company was incorporated as laid beverages, inc .  in january 2020, the 
company was re- named the3rdbevco inc.  for the majority of  the time that the3rdbevco has 
been in business, scalise  was the company’s lone employee .  the3rdbevco does not have any 
securities registered under the exchange act.  
facts  
12. in 2019, scalise formed the3rdbevco.  since its inception, scalise controlled all 
aspects of the3rdbevco, including its offering of securities, the information discl osed in the 
solicitation of investors, and how  it used investor funds.   
13. scalise initially promoted the3rdbevco as a company that would make beverages 
formulated with ingredients that offer health benefits beyond nutritional value and hydration.  
14. scalise later added alcoholic beverages to the products that the3rdbevco was 
supposedly developing.   
15. however, in the nearly five years following its formation, the3rdbevco sold little 
or no product and generated minimal, if any, revenue. 
16. defendants relied heavily on investor funds for the3rdbevco to remain in 
business.   case 2:25-cv-03088-wb     document 1     filed 06/17/25     page 3 of 18

 i. scalise misappropriated and misused investors  funds .  
17. in soliciting investments, including in offering documents and e -mails , 
defendants told investors and potential investors that their funds would be used primarily to 
develop and operate the company’s beverage business. 
18. defendants disclosed , via public filings, that scalise was entitled to certain 
compensation for his work at the company.  however , from 2019 to 2024, scalise took far more 
investor funds than he and the c ompany disclosed or to which he was entitled .   
19. defendants failed to use investor funds as promised. 
20. for example, scalise misappropriated investor funds through direct transfers to 
his or a family member’s personal bank account, payments made directly from the company accounts on his behalf to benefit himself or his family, and cash withdrawals. 
21. scalise misappropriated  these funds to pay personal expenses , such as tuition, 
mortgage  payments , car payments,  and landscaping.   
22. defendants knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that they had not used investor 
funds as promised and that scalise had misappropriated funds for himself and his family.  
23. in total, scalise misappropriated and misused more than $856,000 in investor 
funds . 
ii. defendants misled investors about a potential collaboration with individual 1  
and business ties to individual 1’s brother .  
a. defendants approached individual 1’s brother and touted a potential partnership 
with individual 1.  
 24. over the course of many months, the3rdbevco made numerous 
misrepresentations to existing investors and prospective investors by overstating the company’s 
potential to collaborat e with individual 1 on a purported new rum  brand  using individual 1’s 
nickname and trademark in that brand’s name  (“rum brand”) . case 2:25-cv-03088-wb     document 1     filed 06/17/25     page 4 of 18  
5 
 25. in july 2022, the3rdbevco announced in an e -mail to investors that the company 
engaged in preliminary discussions with individual 1’s management team for a collaboration on 
a new rum brand.  
26. however, no such discussions happened then or ever.  and the rum b rand was 
never produced or sold to consumers.  
27. in july 2022, the3rdbevco approached individual 1’s brother, who was not a part 
of individual 1’s management team, to propose that he become a consultant for the company.   
28. on august 15, 2022, the3rdbevco and individual 1’s brother executed a letter of 
intent, which provided, in part, that , after the parties executed a formal agreement and individual 
1’s brother received his initial compensation, individual 1’s brother would attempt to facilitate  a 
meeting between the3rdbevco and individual 1’s management team.   
29. over the ensuing months, the3rdbevco continued to tout a  connection with 
individual 1. 
30. for example, in an august 29, 2022 e -mail to investors, the3rdbevco provided 
electronic links for investors to review a the3rdbevco slide presentation (the “august 2022 
presentation ”) and a “ commercial” for the purported rum brand. 
31. the august 2022 presentation , which scalise provided to a contractor to include 
in an e -mail to investors, stated that the3rdbevco “partner [s] with grammy winners and g lobal 
super s tars,” referenced individual 1 as part of its marketing strategy, and included next to the 
title of “celebrity brands strategic consultant” a photograph of individual 1 and individual 1’s brother  together . case 2:25-cv-03088-wb     document 1     filed 06/17/25     page 5 of 18  
6 
 32. the “ commercial ” did not explicitly reference individual 1 by name, but it 
included bottles bearing individual 1’s  nickname and trademark and used a popular song 
featuring individual 1’s  vocals as background music without authorization. 
33. similarly, in a september 12, 2022 e -mail, the3rdbevco provided investors with 
an electronic link to an updated version of the “commercial, ” which included bottles bearing 
individual 1’s  nickname and trademark and  used a different popular song with individual 1’ s 
vocals as background music without authorization. 
34. on september 16, 2022, via a newswire service, the3rdbevco issued a press 
release announcing the executed letter of intent with individual 1’s brother .  scalise reviewed and 
edited the  press release and authorized its release to the newswire service.  
35. the press release emphasized the relationship between individual 1 and 
individual 1’s brother , used individual 1’s name, image, and trademark without authorization, 
and stated that there was the potential for the3rdbevco to develop the rum brand with 
individual 1. 
36. the press release also promoted the3rdbevco’s securities offering  pursuant to 
regulation a [17 c.f.r. § 230.251, et seq .].    
37. on the same day, the3rdbevco sent investors an e -mail with a link to the press 
release.  
38. additionally, in a september 20, 2022 e -mail, the3rdbevco told investors that it 
had a productive meeting with individual 1’s brother  and that a meeting with individual 1’s team 
to discuss deal terms was being scheduled for the third week of october.  case 2:25-cv-03088-wb     document 1     filed 06/17/25     page 6 of 18  
7 
 39. in the august 29 and september 12 e -mails  to investors , the3rdbevco included 
an electronic link to a website where investors could purchase shares  of the company’s stock;  
and, in the september 20 e-mail, the c ompany suggested that investors add to their investment.   
40. defendants knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that t hese materials and 
communications with investors were false and misleading. 
41. contrary to the representations in the august 2022 presentation , the3rdbevco did 
not partner with grammy winners or global superstars. 
42. moreover, the references to and images of individual 1 in the august 2022 
presentation  and the unauthorized use of individual 1’s  vocals and trademark in the commercials 
falsely suggested that individual 1 was collaborating with the3rdbevco and gave the 
misimpression that the rum brand was an actual product.   neither was true.  
43. contrary to the representation about a supposed scheduled meeting with 
individual 1’s  team in october 2022, there was no contact between the3rdbevco and individual 
1’s management team to schedule a meeting , and no such meeting ever occurred.  
b. individual 1’s brother complained  about defendants’ use of individual 1 ’s image .  
 
44. on october 10, 2022, individual 1’s brother  complained via e -mail to scalise that 
defendants  should not have used individual 1’s  image without authorization or publicized a non -
existent collaboration  regarding the purported rum brand in  any press release.  
45. scalise replied by e -mail the same day that he understood.   
46. scalise also  agreed  that nothing would be said about the potential to collaborate 
with individual 1 on the rum brand unless  a deal was firmly in place.  case 2:25-cv-03088-wb     document 1     filed 06/17/25     page 7 of 18  
8 
 47. however, a little over two weeks later, on october 28, 2022, the3rdbevco’s 
website still displayed an image of individual 1 with a rum bottle bearing individual 1’s 
nickname and trademark.   
48. that same day, individual 1’s brother complained by phone  to scalise about 
individual 1’s image on the the3rd bevco’s website.  later that day, scalise confirmed by text 
message to i ndividual  1’s brother that the image had been  removed.   
c. the3rdbevco never executed  a formal agreement with individual 1’s brother.  
 
49. although the3rdbevco and individual 1’s brother signed the letter of intent, they 
never finalized a formal agreement , and individual 1’s brother never worked as a consultant for 
the3rdbevco.     
50. in early november 2022, individual 1’s brother  signed the formal agreement 
contemplated by the letter of intent.  however, the3rdbevco never signed the formal agreement.  
51. instead, shortly after individual 1’s brother  signed the agreement , scalise did not 
countersign, and took the extra step of  electronically marking the agreement  void. 
52. had the3rdbevco signed the agreement, the company would have owed 
individual 1’s brother  a signing payment  of $125,000, which was more than the c ompany had in 
its account around that time. 
53. when individual 1’s brother  followed up by text message in early and mid-
november 2022, scalise provided several excuses for not having signed the agreement . 
54. a few weeks later, in december 2022, scalise asked individual 1’s brother  via e-
mail to pitch directly to individual 1 the development of the  rum brand in collaboration with 
the3rdbevco.  case 2:25-cv-03088-wb     document 1     filed 06/17/25     page 8 of 18  
9 
 55. approximately two weeks later, i n a reply e -mail, individual 1’s brother  declined 
to do so and reiterated that , if the3rdbevco had executed a formal agreement with him, his role 
would have be en to facilitate meetings, not pitch ideas .  however, because the agreement was 
never signed, he did not even work to facilitate a meeting.   
d. defendants continued to mislead investors and potential investors about a 
potential collaboration with individual 1.  
  56. even after scalise declined to execute and voided the formal agreement with 
individual 1’s brother , scalise and the3rdbevco represented by e -mail to others, including an 
investment firm and a broker -dealer, that individual 1’s brother  was part of the3rdbevco’s team.   
defendants knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that these representations were false.  
57. for instance, on march 23, 2023, scalise requested that a new member of 
the3rdbevco’s advisory committee reach out to his contacts to solicit investments in 
the3rdbevco.  
58. scalise sent the committee member a template for an e- mail, which stated that 
individual 1’s brother is part of the the3rdbevco’s team.  the template described individual 1 as a “[m]ega star .”  the template further indicated that the sender should attach to any e -mails  a 
presentation similar to the august 2022 presentation  that was circulated to investors.        
59. on april 6, 2023, scalise sent an existing investor and a potential investor a 
presentation  focusing on the rum brand (“april 2023 presentation”) via e- mail.  
60. the april 2023 presentation contained an unauthorized quote attributed to 
individual 1, along with a  fake signature of individual 1’s name , and images of individual 1. 
61. the april 2023 presentation described  the nonexistent rum brand as though it 
was actually in development and used the name from one of individual 1’s popular songs as part of the messaging with an image of individual 1 as the background.  case 2:25-cv-03088-wb     document 1     filed 06/17/25     page 9 of 18  
10 
 62. the april 2023 presentation also referenced individual 1’s  non- profit 
organization, stated that there was an opportunity available with individual 1, and identified that 
opportunity as the r um b rand. 
63. the april 2023 presentation also list ed scalise and his contact information 
underneath a reference to individual 1 and the purported rum brand. 
64. after that e -mail, the existing investor purchased $100,000 worth of shares  of 
the3rdbevco stock.   
65. defendants  knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that their statements regarding 
a potential collaboration with individual 1 were false and misleading. 
66. defendants never spoke with individual 1 or anyone on individual 1’s  
management team about collaborating on the purported rum brand.  defendants never communicated with individual 1 or anyone on individual 1’s management team at all.  
67. defendants never at any time had authorization to use individual 1’s name, 
nickname, image, music, or trademark.  
iii. the3rdbevco repeatedly failed to comply with reg a’s reporting requirements.   68. pursuant to certain requirements, reg a provides a means for companies to sell 
securities to the public without registration.  
69. on february 25, 2022, the s ecurities and exchange commission’s division of 
corporation finance qualified a form 1- a pos filed by the3rdbevco for a securities  offering 
through which the c ompany planned to raise $50 million.  
70. the3rdbevco started sales of reg a shares immediately thereafter.  
71. from 2022 through may 2024, t he company conducted a general solicitation on 
its website, through its social media accounts, and through e -mails.  case 2:25-cv-03088-wb     document 1     filed 06/17/25     page 10 of 18  
11 
 72. potential investors were directed to click a link to a third -party portal that 
processed their investments.  all of the sales of reg a shares were processed through two online 
portals.   
73. reg a require s issuers to file an annual report within 120 calendar days after the 
end of the fiscal year covered by the report and a semi -annual report within 90 calendar days 
after the end of the semi -annual period covered by the report.  if companies fail to file these 
reports as required, they may not rely on the reg a exemption from the registration requirements 
and may not sell  securities during the period of noncompliance  unless another exemption from 
registration applies . 
74. the3rdbevco did not file either of those reports by their respective deadlines.  
instead, the c ompany filed both of these reports on november 1, 2022, approximately five 
months and five weeks late, respectively.  on november 14, 2022, the3rdbevco filed a form 1-z terminating that reg a offering and then, on november 17, 2022, the3rdbevco filed a for m 1-
a for a new offering.  the new reg a offering was qualified on february 8, 2023. 
75. as a result, the3rdbevco did not have an offering qualified pursuant to reg a 
during the period may 1, 2022 through february 7, 2023.   
76. nevertheless, during that period of delinquency, the3rdbevco sold more than 
545,000 shares pursuant to reg a , raising more than $564,000.  no other exemptions from 
registration applied to these securities  sales.  
77. defendants sold and offered for sale these securities using the means and 
instrumentalities of interstate commerce, such as the internet, social media, text messages, and e -
mail.  case 2:25-cv-03088-wb     document 1     filed 06/17/25     page 11 of 18  
12 
 78. the3rdbevco also failed to timely file the required annual and semi- annual 
reports in 2023.  
79. during the period may 1, 2023 through september 15, 2023, while not in 
compliance with reg a, the the3rdbevco impermissibly sold more than $53,000 in securities  
purportedly exempt from the registration requirements pursuant to reg a .  no other exemption 
from registration applied during this period. 
80. defendants sold and offered for sale these securities using the means and 
instrumentalities of interstate commerce, such as the internet, social media, text messages, and e -
mail.  
81. because no valid exemption from registration applied during these periods, 
the3rdbevco’s sales of securities during these periods were improper.  
iv. defendants violated the federal securities laws . 
82. during the relevant period, defendants  defrauded investors and potential 
investors in the3rdbevco.  
83. defendants  engaged in deceptive conduct including, but not limited to, using 
individual 1’s name, image, nickname, music, and trademark in materials provided to investors 
without individual 1’s knowledge, authorization, or consent . 
84. defendants obtained money or property by means of false statements to investors, 
including money that scalise  misappropriated from  investors. 
85. all of the misrepresentations and omissions set forth herein, individually and in 
the aggregate, are material.   
86. defendants  acted knowingly and/or recklessly.  among other things, scalise and 
the3rdbevco knew , or w ere reckless in not knowing, that they  were engaging in deceptive case 2:25-cv-03088-wb     document 1     filed 06/17/25     page 12 of 18  
13 
 conduct and making material ly false and misleading statements  in connection with selling or 
offering of securities.   scalise also knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that he misappropriated 
funds. 
87. scalise and the3rdbevco made false statements of material fact and omitted to 
state material facts necessary to make statements made not misleading.  
88. scalise and the3rdbevco  had ultimate authority for false and misleading 
statements made to existing investors and prospective investors in the  materials and other written 
communications to existing investors  and prospective investors .   
89. defendants  employed a device, scheme or artifice to defraud and engaged in acts, 
transactions or courses of business that operated as a fraud or deceit upon investors. 
90. in perpetrating the fraud, defendants  used the means or instruments of interstate 
commerce or of the mails, or the facility of a national securities exchange, including by sending 
numerous documents containing false statements via e -mail.  
91. the conduct described herein was in connection with the purchase or sale of 
securities.   
92. defendants sold and offered to sell securities without a valid registration as to 
those securities or a valid exemption from registration. 
93. defendants used the means or instruments of interstate commerce or the mails , 
including e -mails,  to sell, and offer for sale, the unregistered securities.  case 2:25-cv-03088-wb     document 1     filed 06/17/25     page 13 of 18

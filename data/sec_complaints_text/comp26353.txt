complaint against defendants shahnawaz mathias a/k/a “shah” mathias (“mathias”), ameri 
metro, inc. (“ameri metro”), penndel land de velopment co. (“penndel”), and hsrf trust 
(“hsrf”), and alleges as follows: 
summary 
1. from at least july 2020 until at least april 2024 (the “relevant time”), mathias,
and others acting at his direc tion, offered for sale and sold approximately $2.4 million worth of 
ameri metro shares through penndel and hsrf  by making false and misleading material 
statements (including those misleading by omission) about  ameri metro’s operations, case 1:25-cv-02313     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 1 of 27

 acquisitions, and valuation in its public reports filed with the commission.  the offers and sales 
of these securities were not covered by a registrati on statement or applicable exemption from 
registration.  
2. since its inception, ameri metro, under math ias’s control, filed dozens of current 
reports on form 8-k and several annual reports on form 10-k with the commission describing 
transactions with other mathias- owned and controlled companies that purportedly were working 
on large-scale projects.   although many of these filings involve seemingly baseless speculation 
about future activities, at least three of these 8-ks, and two of the forms 10-k, included material 
misrepresentations. 
3. three separate forms 8-k filed by mathia s and ameri metro contained false and 
misleading statements that ameri metro and/or it s subsidiaries had acquired: (1) “an easement 
consisting of 1,000 acres for development of an  inland port” in penns ylvania valued at $260 
million; (2) “easements and other ri ghts that relate to certain real property consisting of 4,443 
single-family building lots, two golf courses, 30 acres of comm ercial mixed-use land, 20 acres 
for development of public schools, 20 acres fo r construction of civic buildings, and land for 
construction of sewer treatment facilities” locate d in san bernadino, california, with a purchase 
price of $541,369,000; and (3) a company that ha d “historically generated approximately $85.0 
million in profits from its $1.0b in annual revenues . . . .”   
4. mathias also signed two mis leading forms 10-k on beha lf of ameri metro for 
fiscal years ending july 31, 2022 and 2023, and filed in april of 2024, which, among other 
things, contained the false and misleading statement that ameri metro “has solidified funding of 
approximately $950,000,000,000 from large financial institutions.”  case 1:25-cv-02313     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 2 of 27

 5. in reality, neither ameri metro nor its s ubsidiaries had acquired the easements, 
rights, or the profitable company, nor ha d they secured $950,000,000,000 in funding.  as the 
control person of the ent ities on both sides of these transactions, mathias knew or was reckless in 
not knowing that the statements in the above f ilings were materially false and misleading.   
6. by engaging in the conduct described herein, defendants vi olated, and unless 
enjoined will continue to violate sections 5(a)  and (c), and 17(a) of the securities act of 1933 
(“securities act”) [15 u.s.c. §§ 77e (a) and (c); 15 u.s.c. § 77q(a )], and sections 10(b),  13(a), 
and 20(a) of the securities exchange act of 1934 (“exchange act”) [15 u.s.c. § 78j(b), 15 
u.s.c. § 78m(a), and 15 u.s. c. § 78t(a)] and rules 10b-5, 12 b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-11 thereunder 
[17 c.f.r. § 240.10b-5,  and 17 c.f.r. §§ 240.12b-20, 240.13a-1, and 240.13a-11].

15. ameri metro 2010 is described in a filing with the commission as the original, 
pre-merger version of “ameri metro, inc.”, which was incorporated in delaware on april 13,

mathias, noted that as of ja nuary 31, 2024, ameri metro had approxi mately 4.6 billion shares of 
stock outstanding, ranging from preferred stock to classes a through d of common stock, all 
listed with a par value of $0.000001.   
22. transfer agent records reflect that mathia s and entities he controlled owned the 
majority of the outstanding shares of ameri metro during the relevant time. case 1:25-cv-02313     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 6 of 27

 23. because ameri metro had a class of secu rities registered pursuant to section 
12(g) of the exchange act duri ng the relevant time, it was re quired to make periodic public 
filings with the commission.  am ong other things, ameri metro was required to file annual 
reports on form 10-k to provide a comprehens ive overview of its business and financial 
condition along with audited financ ial statements. 17 c.f.r § 240.13a-1.  in addition, for each of 
the first three quarters of its fiscal year, ameri metro was required to file a quarterly report on 
form 10-q that included unaudited financial statements and provi ded a continuing view of the 
company’s financial posture during the year.  17 c.f.r § 240.13a-13.  and ameri metro was 
also required to file forms 8-k to report material events on an ongoing basis.  17 c.f.r § 
240.13a-11.  these reports are filed with the co mmission, posted on the commission’s website, 
and thereby made available to the investing public. 
24. ameri metro made dozens of filings with the commission claiming to have 
entered into contracts (almost ex clusively with other mathias-created and controlled entities) to 
develop a long list of projects, although it never actually developed any such projects.     
25. during the relevant time, ameri metro also had a public website 
(http://buystock.ameri-metro.co m/home) (“ameri metro’s website ”) which stated that ameri 
metro and a wholly owned subsidiary were:  
… pioneers of “ppp” private public partnership, of infr astructure projects and 
transportation projects.  the company is a “conduit” to “facilitate”, “general 
contracting” services for infrastructur e projects and transportation projects 
collectively called infrastr ucture projects nationally. 
 
26. ameri metro transferred its securities to  other mathias-owne d entities, including 
penndel and hsrf, purportedly as part of the contracts to develop th e projects described on 
ameri metro’s website and in filings with the commission.   case 1:25-cv-02313     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 7 of 27

 27. at mathias’s direction, penndel and hs rf, in turn, sold the ameri metro 
securities to investors for appr oximately $1 to $2 per share.   
28. the proceeds from these sales were commingled in the various bank accounts of 
penndel, hsrf, ameri metro, and mathias.  mathias was the signatory on all of those accounts.     
29. ameri metro shares owned by penndel and hsrf were securities that were 
publicly offered or sold by gene ral solicitation or general advertising, specifically by posting an 
advertisement, article, notice or other comm unication via the ameri metro website, which 
included a “buy shares now” tab, as depicted in this  screen capture of an archived version of the 
top of ameri metro’s we bsite from august 9, 2020: 
 
30. ameri metro employees also  solicited investors through phone calls and personal 
meetings.   
31. during the relevant time, defendants offere d for sale and sold shares of ameri 
metro to over 150 investors.  t hose investors entered into sales agreements wit h, and received 
ameri metro shares fro m, either penndel or hsrf.  these sales generated a total of 
approximately $2.4 million in proceeds.   
32. ameri metro failed to register the offer and sale of the ameri metro securities by 
hsrf and penndel during the relevant time. 
case 1:25-cv-02313     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 8 of 27

 33. the offers and sales did not qualify for an exemption from filing a registration 
statement with the commission.   
34. while a form d, “notice of exemption o ffering of securities,” was filed on may 
28, 2020, which cited rule 506(b) as an exemption from the requirement to register, that filing 
did not exempt the shares sold  during the relevant time.   
35. no exemption applies because, at mathias’s direction, ameri metro shares were 
offered or sold during the relevant time by general solicitation or general advertising, 
specifically by posting an advertisem ent, article, notice or other communication via the internet, 
that is, offering shares for sa le on ameri metro’s website.   
b. defendants made misrepresentations in filings with the commission. 
36. during the relevant time, at least three forms 8-k filed with the commission 
included an untrue statement of mate rial fact and/or omitted to stat e a material fact necessary in 
order to make the statement(s) made, in light of th e circumstances under which the statement(s) 
were made, not misleading, about  ameri metro and its existing operations.  these documents 
were later attached as exhibits to certain forms 10-q and 10-k f iled by ameri metro, in an effort 
to continue raising investor funds.   
37. in april 2024, mathias signed two additional forms 10-k on behalf of ameri 
metro which included an untrue statement of material  fact and/or omitted to  state a material fact 
necessary to make the statement(s) made, in  light of the circumst ances under which the 
statement(s) were made, not mis leading, about $950 b illion in funding purportedly available to 
ameri metro. case 1:25-cv-02313     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 9 of 27

 1. july 22, 2020 false filing: the $1 billion “port trajan” project. 
38. on july 22, 2020, mathias caused ameri metro to file a form 8-k which falsely 
claimed that hsr logistics had “acquired an easement consisting of 1,000 acres for 
development of an inland port” from jewel’s real estate.  the filing further noted, “based on the 
value of the land, with 4 million square feet of fully developed warehousing space the estimate 
overall value of the easement is $260,000,000.” 
39. jewel’s real estate did not own the easement it was supposedly selling. 
40. further, neither jewel’s r eal estate, mathias, nor a ny entity mathias owned or 
controlled, had sufficient assets to acquire  the easement from the actual landowner(s). 
41. the form 8-k attached a document whic h provided additional detail regarding 
this purported project, which wa s referred to as “port trajan de velopment” and had an estimated 
cost of $1 billion.  port trajan was described as “a transportation mu ltimodal hub and logistics 
center” located in antrim township, greencastle , pennsylvania.  the document stated that 
ameri metro planned to provide  a “distribution center consis ting of terminals with rail 
connections to ns and csx facilities.”   
42. at the time of the 2020 filing, mathias kne w or was reckless in not knowing that 
there was no ongoing viable port trajan project. 
43. both ns (norfolk southern corp.) a nd csx (csx transportation) are rail 
transportation providers with faci lities in the geographic area de scribed in the filing.  neither 
company has any record of any communication with defendants or  entities referenced in the 
filings related to defendants. 
44. antrim township officials confirmed that individuals working for and with 
antrim township held meetings with mathias in  2013 regarding a purported rail and easement case 1:25-cv-02313     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 10 of 27  
11 
 related project that was similar to  port trajan as described in th e form 8-k filed in july of 2020.  
however, after a second meeting in the summ er of 2013 between officials with antrim 
township and mathias, it was clear that antrim township officials could not enter into the 
agreement(s) mathias proposed.  there was no deal as no agreement was reached.  antrim 
township considered the matter closed.   
45. this false and misleading form 8-k was in cluded as an exhibit to ameri metro’s 
subsequent form 10-k for fiscal year ended july 31, 2021, which was filed with the commission 
on october 27, 2021.  it was also included as an exhibit to ameri metro’s form 10-q for the 
quarter ended october 31, 2020, which was fi led with the commission on december 21, 2020. 
2. september 4, 2020 false filing: $915 billion valuation report. 
46. on september 4, 2020, mathias and ameri metro made materi ally false and 
misleading claims regarding the company’s success and value in a form 8-k which it labeled as 
an item 7.01 regulation fd disclosure and a ttached a document entitled “valuation report 
prepared by ameri metro, inc. ma nagement assisted by norasia consulting & advisory to the 
board of directors” (the  “valuation report”) whic h was dated august 31, 2020.  
47. the valuation report stated that as of  august 31, 2020, the “a djusted book value” 
of ameri metro based on its 25% ownership interest in several related companies (mathias 
owned the remaining 75% interest in these rela ted companies) was over $915 billion, despite the 
fact that that those companies neve r had any operations or assets.   
48. the valuation report read, in pertinent part: 
the company has no historical earnings but with [sic] recen t acquisition of 
profitable companies, such as marfin investment group which has historically 
generated approximately $85.0 million in profits fr om its $1.0b in annual 
revenues these acquisitions will provide hi storical and proven earnings to ameri 
metro. 
 case 1:25-cv-02313     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 11 of 27  
12 
 49. this statement was false, as neither am eri metro nor mathias acquired or held 
any ownership interest in marfin investment group.  marfin investme nt group is the former 
name of mig holdings s.a., based in athens , the hellenic republic, and is a real estate 
investment and holding company.   
50. mig holdings s.a. has confirmed that ameri metro and mathias did not control 
a percentage equal to or greater  than 5%, which would require publ ic disclosure.  further, mig 
holdings s.a. indicated that, to the best of their knowledge, ameri me tro and mathias “do not, 
in any way, participate in our company or in any of our company’s subsidiaries, all of which are 
100% controlled by our company.” 
51. mathias knew or was reckless in not know ing that ameri metro had not acquired 
marfin investment group, and th at ameri metro also had not ev er acquired other “profitable 
companies” that had “historical and proven ea rnings” sufficient to justify a $915 billion 
valuation.  
52. the valuation report containing this same  misrepresentation about marfin was 
included as an exhibit to several subsequent peri odic filings by ameri metro, including its form 
10-k for the fiscal year ended july 31, 2022, as we ll as its form 10-k for the fiscal year ended 
july 31, 2023, which were both signed by mathias and filed with the commission on april 23, 
2024. 
3. november 5, 2021 false filing: $722 mil lion real estate development. 
53. on november 5, 2021, mathias caused ameri me tro to file a mate rially false and 
misleading form 8-k which described a purported real estate development deal that involved 
jewel’s real estate and ameri metro cryptocurrency, jointly defined as “seller,” and ameri case 1:25-cv-02313     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 12 of 27  
13 
 metro, defined as “buyer,” with a purcha se price of $541,369,000.  th e property that was 
purportedly involved in this deal was located in san bernadino, ca. 
54. the filing provided the following details re garding this purported transaction:  
seller provided buyer all righ ts to develop and acquire easements and other rights 
that relate to certain real  property consisting of 4,443 single-family building lots, 
two golf courses, 30 acres of commercial mixed-use land, 20 acres for 
development of public schools, 20 acres fo r construction of civic buildings, and 
land for construction of sewer treatment facilities, located in california (the 
“property”). 
 55. in a second transaction, ameri metro, th e “buyer,” purportedly assigned all of 
“its right, title and interest, together with all of its obligations and du ties” to malibu homes for 
$722,738,000, to be paid in consumptive use tokens called “ameri coin” which were developed 
by ameri metro cryptocurrency.   
56. the form 8-k attached agreements docu menting these purported transactions. 
57. despite representations to the contrary, neither ameri metro, mathias, or any of 
the entities controlled by mathias referenced in the form 8-k deta iling this real estate project 
owned a single parcel of prope rty in san bernadino county.  mo reover, ameri metro had almost 
no cash or other assets at the time – certainl y not assets worth anything close to $541,369,000 to 
make this acquisition.  nor did the company have any arrangements for financing that would 
have covered that purchase price.   
4. april 2024 false filings: $950 billion financing arrangement with 
“large financial institutions”  
58. in april 2024, mathias signed two false and misleading forms 10-k on behalf of 
ameri metro for the fiscal years ending july 31, 2022 and 2023, which, among other things, 
falsely stated that ameri metro “has solidified funding of approximately $950,000,000,000 from 
large financial institutions.”  case 1:25-cv-02313     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 13 of 27  
14 
 59. at no time did ameri metro r eceive $950,000,000,000 in funding from any 
financial institutions.  there is no record of a ny deposit greater than $200,000 into the identified 
corporate bank accounts of ameri metro, penndel, and hsrf.   
c. ameri metro’s registration is revoked. 
60. ameri metro filed a form 10-q with the commission in march of 2022 which 
covered the quarterly period that ended january  31, 2022.  thereafter, am eri metro failed to 
timely file required form 10-qs.   
61. on september 12, 2023, the commission issued  an order instituting proceedings 
against ameri metro to deter mine whether it was appropriate  to suspend or revoke the 
registration of ameri metro secur ities based on failure to file ti mely and accurate information in 
its periodic reports pursuant to sec tion 12(j) of the exchange act.   
62. in april of 2024, ameri metro filed a number of forms 10-q and 10-k with the 
commission.  the filing did not contain requir ed current financial statements or other 
disclosures, but did include pr ior filings as attachments. 
63. on january 17, 2025, the commission entered an order by consent revoking 
ameri metro’s registration pursuan t to exchange act section 12(j) , effective as of january 21, 
2025. 
unregistered sale of securities  
64. sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the securities act require that an issuer register the offer 
or sale of securities with the sec absent an applicable exemption from  registration.  mathias 
controlled all aspects of the ma nagement of ameri metro, penndel and hsrf, including their 
offer and sale of securities.    case 1:25-cv-02313     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 14 of 27  
15 
 65. defendants offered and sold securities in the form of ameri metro stock to 
investors through penndel and hsrf without first having filed a registrati on statement with the 
commission for the offering and without any a pplicable exemption fr om registration.   
66. while ameri metro had filed registration statements in the past, none of those 
filings registered the offer and sale of securities during the relevant time.   
67. from july 2020 to april 2024, defendants, di rectly and indirectl y, offered for sale 
and sold securities – shares of ameri metro – to over 150 investors, through penndel and hsrf.  
these sales generated a total of approxima tely $2.4 million in proceeds.      
68. ameri metro offered securities for sale in interstate commerce, specifically on the 
internet through ameri metro’s we bsite.  in addition, the offers of securities used interstate 
facilities or the mails and interstate commerce, specifically the internet, including ameri metro’s 
website, and the commission’s website, to circ ulate information about the securities.    
69. defendants engaged one or more  stock transfer agent(s) that in turn used means of 
interstate commerce, including the mails, to send and receive agreements and certificates with 
investors. 
70. penndel and hsrf directly offered and sold ameri metro stock to the public 
without registration or an  applicable exemption. 
71. mathias played an integral role in the o ffer and sale of ameri metro shares.  for 
example, mathias actively promoted  the sale of ameri metro shares , actively recruited investors 
to purchase ameri metro shares by making periodic telepho ne calls to investors, maintained the 
scheme by participating in peri odic conference calls with investors to provide updates, and 
directly sold ameri metr o shares to investors. case 1:25-cv-02313     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 15 of 27

 defendants violated the antifraud provisions 
72. defendants knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that the disclosures in the 
three forms 8-k and two forms 10-k, and later fi lings that incorporated them, contained false 
and misleading statements (inc luding those rendered  misleading due to omissions) regarding 
ameri metro’s operations, ac quisitions, and valuation. 
73. defendants knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that shares of ameri metro 
sold after those public filings with the commis sion were based on fraudulent disclosures.   
defendants’ conduct presented a danger of misleading buyers or sellers that was either known to 
defendants or was so obvious that defe ndants must have been aware of it. 
74.   the misstatements (or misstatements misleading by omission) were made by 
mathias and ameri metro in ameri metro’s filings with the commission, over which mathias exercised ultimate authority and control.   
75. mathias controlled ameri metro, penndel a nd hsrf, and directed the actions of 
ameri metro, penndel, and hsrf, in the furthera nce of the scheme to defraud investors.  
76. the misstatements (or misstatements misl eading by omission) were material as 
there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor  would consider the information 
important in making an investment  decision.  these material misstat ements describe real estate 
acquisitions purportedly worth hundreds of millions  of dollars and the acquisition of a company 
generating $85 million in annual pr ofits from $1 billion in revenue when, in reality, ameri metro 
had no operations or revenue.  the misstatements were made repeatedly in reports filed with the 
commission and were publicly available to i nvestors both on the sec.gov website and links to 
those filings on ameri metro’s website when making their decision to buy ameri metro shares.   case 1:25-cv-02313     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 16 of 27  
17 
 77. mathias also engaged in deceptive co nduct by creating agreements between his 
entities, none of which had any operations, purporting to transfer valuable property rights when 
those entities did not actually ow n the purported rights.  he att ached those agreements to sec 
filings to support his claims. 
78. mathias perpetrated his fraudulent scheme with a years-long course of conduct 
involving false filings and agreem ents amongst his entities that gave the investors the false 
impression that ameri metro wa s a thriving business.   
79. the fraudulent conduct occurred in connect ion with the purchase and sale of 
ameri metro securities si nce the sales occurred during the rele vant time, after the filings with 
the commission that contained materially  false and misleading statements.   
80. mathias, and by extension the entities he owned and controlled, acted with 
scienter.  mathias knew that his entities did not actually own either the easement or land in the 
pennsylvania and california tran sactions.  and mathias knew th at none of his companies had 
any actual operations or assets, yet he publicly claimed in a form 8-k filed with the commission 
that he had acquired a business wi th over $1 billion in revenue and mi llions in profits.  he also 
knew or was reckless in not knowing that ameri metro had not secured $950 billion in funding 
from large financial instituti ons, but signed two forms 10-k containing that statement. 
81. defendants received money from the sale  of ameri metro shares when the 
proceeds of those sales were commingled amon gst their bank accounts, all of which were 
controlled by mathias.  mathias, penndel and hs rf used the misstatements in ameri metro’s 
filings to obtain money from the sa le of shares to  investors.   case 1:25-cv-02313     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 17 of 27  
18 
 82. defendants further knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that they were engaged 
in a scheme to defraud investor s and further engaged in practice s that operated as a fraud or 
deceit upon those investors by sel ling ameri metro shares based on fraudulent disclosures.   
false and misleading statem ents in public filings 
83. ameri metro, as an issuer with securities register ed under section 12 of the 
exchange act, is required under section 13(a) of  the exchange act and rules 13a-1, and 13a-11 
thereunder to file annual, and current reports with the commission containing such information 
as the commission’s rules prescribe.  in addition,  rule 12b-20 requires that reports contain such 
further material information as may be necessary to make the required statements, in light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  
84. ameri metro violated section 13(a) and rule 13a-11 thereunder in connection 
with its false and misleading statements and half-truths in its forms 8-k related to: (1) its purported agreements concerning th e port trajan project in penns ylvania (filed july 22, 2020); 
(2) the book value of ameri metro and its stock,  and its acquisition of marfin, a purportedly 
profitable business (filed september 4, 2020, with  an attached valuation report); and (3) a 
purported agreement concerning a california real estate development (filed november 5, 2021). 
85. in violation of section 13(a) and ru les 12b-20 and 13a-1, ameri metro falsely 
claimed to have solidified funding of $950 billio n from large financial in stitutions in its forms 
10-k for the fiscal years ending ju ly 31, 2022 and 2023 (filed april 23, 2024). 
86. mathias aided and abetted ameri metr o’s violations because he provided 
substantial assistance to ameri metro in com mitting these violations by providing information 
about the underlying transactions, and participating in the drafting, review, and approval of each 
of the relevant filings discussed above.   case 1:25-cv-02313     document 1     filed 07/18/25     page 18 of 27  
19 
 87. since the disclosures in these filings invol ved transactions with  related entities 
owned and controlled by mathia s, he provided the misleadi ng information concerning the 
transactions and had direct knowledge of whether the filings were accurately describing the 
transactions.   
88. mathias aided and abetted ameri metro’s violations because he also signed the 
forms 10-k for the fiscal years ended july 31, 2022 and 2023, both of which falsely stated that 
ameri metro had secured $950 billion in f unding from large fina ncial institutions. 
89. the misleading statements in public filings  were made in violation of section 
17(a) of the securities act and section 10(b) of  the exchange act and rule 10b-5 thereunder, 
along with the specific exchange act rule s summarized in the following table:

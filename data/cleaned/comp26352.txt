statements while raising more than  250 million for caastle through the offer and sale of preferred stock and common warrants 2 hunsickers fake financials supported her narrative that caastle a startup that offered a new monetization model called clothing asaservice to the apparel industry  enjoyed rapid and steady revenue growth after a rebrand of the business in 2018 achieved profitability by december 2022 experienced exponential increases in profitability thereafter and was nearing an initial public offering or sale  in reality caastles revenues were shrinking its losses were increasing  and the company was never profitable case 125cv05897 document 1 filed 071825 page 1 of 32 2 3 throughout the relevant period not a single existing or prospective caastle investor received

owned a smaller percentage of the company than they realized case 125cv05897 document 1 filed 071825 page 2 of 32 3 7 occasionally hunsicker herself was the undisclosed seller in secondary transaction s and received for her preferred shares the price at which caastle was selling shares in its then current funding round not the negotiated discounted price  in other words hunsicker orchestrated transactions in which she benefitted herself at the companys and investors expense  8 hunsickers scheme began to unravel in late 2024 when multiple investors reviewed caastles falsified 2 023 audit

process of engaging an auditor  as 2022 progressed hunsicker told investors that as a private company caas tle was not high on the auditors priority list and the audit was slow  going and not complete  investors began to express concern about the audit delays 63 hunsicker ultimately decided after having told investors that they can expect to see audited financials in 2022 to falsify caastles fiscal year 2021 audit report to provide a falsified audit to investors 64 on or around november 30 2022 hunsicker asked her finance team to locate a nonfinal draft of the fiscal year 2021 audit report the

the auditor were still turning versions of the audit report but that the draft was further along than she expected the draft contained an income statement that reflected revenue of approximately 1205 million for the fiscal year  a material improvement over the prior fiscal year  and operating losses of 337 million the draft contained a balance sheet that reflected a cash balance of appro ximately 302 million as of september 30 2021 these numbers were materially false and not reflective of caastles internal records  case 125cv05897 document 1 filed 071825 page 15 of 32 16 66 between december

approximately 1205 million operating losses of approximately 337 million and a materially inflated cash balance of approximately 303 million as of september 30 2021 hunsicker changed the numbers

become profitable or cash flow positive by december 2022 case 125cv05897 document 1 filed 071825 page 16 of 32 17 70 hunsickers announcement increased the appetite of caastle investors for audited financial statements  which hunsicker appeased by creat ing a fake draft audit report with fake financial statements and fake notes for fiscal year ended september 30 2022 fiscal year 2022  and then creat ing a fake final fiscal year 2022 audit report to which she added auditor 1s signature  71 on april 4 2023 hunsicker emailed two existing and prospective investor s what purported to be a n april 3 2023 draft of the fiscal year 202 2 audit report she told the investor s that caastles auditor was working through presentation issues completing its audit of the capitalization table and finalizing the notes  suggesting that the financial statements in the draft report were near final or final in reality  the draft was a fake created by hunsicker herself  the income statement reflected revenue of approximately  2385 million for the fiscal year nearly double the amount that had been reflected in the fake fiscal year 2021 audit report  the balance sheet reflected a cash balance of approximately  425 million as of september 30 2022 these numbers did not comport with caastles internal records  the accompanying audit opinion letter and notes were devoid of any reference to caastle as a going concern  72 one day after receiving hunsickers falsified  draft  of the fiscal year 2022 audit report a prospective investor that had tracked caastles fake financial performance for years sought authorization from its investment committee to commit 75 million to purchase shares of caastles series a 12 preferred stock and common warrants  the false data that hunsicker sent to the investor  including fake fiscal 2021 and 2022 financial data  was important to the investors decision making process  the investor s igned a stock purchase agreement a warrant purchase agreement

half of the prior fiscal year and a materially inflated cash balance of approximately 425 million as of september 30 2022 hunsicker cut and pasted into the document auditor 1s signature from a prior years audit report  like the fake draft hunsickers fake final fiscal year 2022 audit report did not express warnings about caastles ability to continue as a going concern or its need to continue to raise capital to continue as a going concern  74 hunsicker knew or was reckless or negligent in not knowing that the financial information reflected in the draft and final fiscal year 2022 audit

statements and records that her finance team sent earlier the internal records reflected fiscal 2022 revenues of approximately 20 million  operating losses of approximately 341 million and net losses of approximately 40 million and a september 30 2022 cash balance of approximately 621000 75 hunsicker also knew when she sent the fake draft and final fiscal year 2022 audit reports that a caastle was

december 2 2024 t he audited financial statements reported fiscal year 2022 revenues of approximately 197 million and operating losses of approximately 585 million and a cash balance of less than 750 000 as of september 30 2022 these numbers were materially consistent with the internal reports that hunsicker had received before sending her falsified fiscal 2022 financials to investors  77 the audit report was accompanied by a clean audit opinion with auditor 2s conclusion that caastles financial statements for fiscal year 202 2 presented fairly in all material respects caastles financial position in accordance with us gaap the audit report noted that that  caast le has suffered recurring losses from operations and requires additional debt or equity financing in the future to continue to fund its operations which cannot be guaranteed these factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern 78 hunsicker received a copy of the final audit report on december 2 2024 she did not send the r eport to any investors or provide investors with corrected fiscal year 2022 financial information vi hunsicker lied to cover her tracks relating to caastles fiscal 202 2 financials and audit report 79 hunsickers scheme nearly unraveled in october 2023 before she sent misleading financial statements to any i nvestor for the fiscal year ended september 30 2023 h er lies kept the scheme alive for over one more year  80 in september 2023 an investor who received the fake fiscal year 2022 audit report from hunsicker noticed errors in the report that suggested it might not be fin al the investor emailed the fake report to auditor 1 and asked if auditor 1 had conducted and completed the audit for fiscal year 2022  auditor 1 told the investor tha t the report was not signed by case 125cv05897 document 1 filed 071825 page 19 of 32 20 auditor 1 and was not a legitimate auditor 1 opinion  auditor 1 contacted caastles head of finance and financial controller and hunsicker  hunsicker explained that this was a one off error she claimed that she had mistakenly sent the investor a marked up version of the audit report that she intended to use in a lecture she was giving at princeton university on ethics and entrepreneurship 81 auditor 1 terminated its relationship with caastle on october 3 2023 a lthough skeptical of hunsickers story  auditor 1 did not report her to the board of directors caastles head of finance and financial controller believed hunsickers excuse and also did not report her to the board of directors caastle r edeemed the investor s shares at cost  and the investor did not report hunsicker to the board of directors 82 although hunsicke r took out personal loa ns and provide d the proceeds to caastle to enable it to redeem the investors shares the loans came from caastle investors who were misled about how she intended to use the loan proceeds  she ultimately repaid a majority of the loans by selling some of her personal shares of caastle preferred stock to an investor who had received false financials from her and w as unaware of her fraud  the investor forgave his own 4 million loan to hunsicker and then paid an additional 35 million purportedly to purchase 75 million some of her personal shares at a discounted price she attempted to repay the rest of her personal loans by wiring funds from caastles bank account to the investor lender  who has since returned the funds to caastl e and insisted that hunsicker pay the loan from her personal funds  83 with the board of directors unaware of hunsickers actions or the real reason why auditor 1 had terminated its relationsh ip with caastle hunsicker continue d her scheme  84 exactly two business day s after auditor 1 terminated its relationship with caastle hunsicker sent to a long term caastle investor the fake fiscal year 2022 final audit report case 125cv05897 document 1 filed 071825 page 20 of 32 21 that auditor 1 had denounced the investor purchased additional shares of caastle s a12 preferred stock and common warrants days later for its own account and an account held for the benefit of a client for over 25 million 85 in march 2024 hunsicker sent the fake fiscal year 2022 audit report to another existing caastle investor in april 2024 the investor purchased more than 15 million additional preferred shares and common warrants for itself and a group of coinvestors vii hunsicker falsified caastles fiscal 202 3 financials and audit report 86 on september 24 2024 as part of her continuing efforts to raise capital for caastle hunsicker gave an investor access to a data room that contained a purported final audit report for fiscal years end ed september 30 2022 and 2023  the document was a fake created by hunsicker  the financial statements reflected fiscal 2023 revenues of approximately 4399 million total profits of approximately 663 million and a cash balance of approximately 1128 million as of september 30 2023 which did not comport with caastles internal records  87 hunsicker knew or was reckless or negligent in not knowing that the fiscal 2023 financial information reflected in the audit report was materially false and did not comport with caastles internal records 88 caastles true fiscal year 2023 financial performance was dismal in comparison  caastles internal records  which hunsicker had received from her finance team beforehand  reflected fiscal 202 3 revenues of approximately  156 million  operating losses of approximately 396 million net losses of approximately 472 million and a september 30 2023 cash balance of approximately 880000 89 hunsicker also knew when she sent the fake fiscal year 20222023 audit report to investors that auditor 2 had not completed its fiscal 2023 audit yet  she drafted the report  she case 125cv05897 document 1 filed 071825 page 21 of 32 22 cut and pasted auditor 1s signature into the report from a prior audit she scanned the document to herself 90 the fake fiscal year 2022 2023 audit report contained multiple facial errors it was missing page 7 the stockholders equity report  the notes were out ofdate and t he audit opinion letter purported to be signed by auditor 1 on august 30 2024 91 within days of receiving the fake fiscal year 2022 2023 audit report from hunsicker the investor described in paragraph 86 wired more than 25 million to caastle to purchase preferred shares and common warrants 92 several weeks later  hunsicker offered two different investors an opportunity to view the supposed final fiscal year 2022 2023 audit report in her office  both investors accepted the offer they were shown the same fake audit report that hunsicker had loaded to the data room on september 24 93 auditor 2 completed caastle s fiscal year 202 3 audit on december 2 2024 and issued it as a joint fiscal year 2022 2023 audit report  the audit ed financial statements reported fiscal 2023 revenues of approximately  157 million  operating losses of approximately 807 million and a cash balance of less than  950000 as of september 30 2023 these numbers were materially consistent with the internal reports that hunsicker had received from her finance team before sending falsified fiscal 202 3 financials to investors  except for the audited loss figure which was materially larger in comparison to the companys internal records 94 caastle was not profitable or cash flow positive in fiscal year 2023 nor was it financing operations from its own cash flow it had less than 1 million in cash and had suffered its largest losses to date the real fiscal year 2022 2023 audit report noted that that  caast le has suffered recurring losses from operations and requires additional debt or equity financing in case 125cv05897 document 1 filed 071825 page 22 of 32 23 the future to continue to fund its operations which cannot be guaranteed these factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern this is the same message that previously appeared in every one of caastles real audit reports ii hunsicker procure d investments using misleading sales tactics 95 by mid 2022 hunsicker also hid from investors the extent to which caastle continued to rely on primary capital raises to fund its operations and she provided capitalization tables that misled investors about caastles true capital structure i nvestors who wanted to participate in secondary transactions ended up mostly participating in primary offerings and investor interests were diluted as a result  96 prior to 2022 caastle raised capital by selling original issue common shares and successive rounds of preferred shares to investors  by late 2021 hunsicker began to tell investors that caastle had largely completed its capital raising rounds and was moving into a final pre ipo round by july 2022 she told investors that caastle was close to generating cash and may not have another capital raising round the false financial statements she provided to investors in march 2023 fit her inaccurate narrativ e and falsely represented that caastle had become profitable and cash flow positive by december 31 2022 and was capable of generating sufficient revenue to independently fund its operations without the need for primary capital raises caastles fake fiscal year 2022 2023 audit report represented that caastle had not raised capital since the end of fiscal 2022 97 in reality caastles financial performance had worsened and caastle relied on hunsickers continued ability to raise capital in order to survive  investors were unaware of this fact several investors only invested because they believed they were buying discounted shares in secondary transactions if they had known that caastle was continuing to raise capital  when its case 125cv05897 document 1 filed 071825 page 23 of 32 24 balance sheet suggested that caastle has cash rich  that information would have influenced their investment decision 98 hunsicker structure d the supposed secondary transactions in a manner that allowed her to conceal the true nature of the transaction s as a primary capital raising event s she told prospective buyers that she was facilitating resales from early investors in caastle who were facing liquidity issues or other requirements to sell their shares  then a cting as intermediary she purported to negotiate the transaction on behalf of both sides  the buyers had no contact with the supposed sellers  the buyer s execute d transactional documents with caastle and wired funds to caastle and caastle was supposed to use the proceeds to purchase shares from the seller 99 the selling investors that hunsicker described for the most part did not exist the majority of the shares sold in purported secondary transactions were newly issued caastle shares caastle used the funds for operations 100 for example  on august 16 2023 hunsicker solicited a prospective investor telling him she had an employee who desperately needs some liquidity for an elder care situation hunsicker told the prospective investor that caastle would act as middleman by purchasing the shares from the employee and then sellin g shares to the investor the selling employee that hunsicker described did not exist  the buyer purchased one million shares believing the shares would come from reissuances of previously issued shar es caastle then issued a mix of new preferred and common shares to the buyer  the investors new shares increased the number of outstanding shares by one million as reflected on caastles internal capitalization table hunsicker made the same offer concerning the same fictitious seller to multiple other investors several of whom purchase d shares in transactions that caas tle recorded as original share issuances case 125cv05897 document 1 filed 071825 page 24 of 32 25 101 occasionally hunsicker herself was the seller in a secondary transaction though she concealed her identity from the buyer  and caastle paid her full price to redeem her shares not the negotiated discounted price paid by the buyer 102 for example on july 25 2022 hunsicker emailed an existing caastle investor with an opportunity to purchase shares from another caastle investor who she claimed had become a director of a large chinese public company and was being pushed by the chinese government  to sell his us tech stocks  hunsicker told the investor that because the seller is getting pressure hes willing to do a substantial discount on his shares at a price of 205 per share which hunsicker described as a 67 discount to the price at which caastle sold shares in its last fundraising round a day later after the investor stated that he needed time to determine how much he could invest hunsicker told the investor that the seller would be willing to sell 25 of his available shares to the investor for 150 per share  hunsicker then pressured the investor to act telling him that caastle would likely not do another funding round since we are so close to generating cash hunsicker also sent the investor false income statements covering the period january through june 2022 and a false balance sheet as of june 30 2022 103 the investor agreed to purchase the shares at 150 per share and wired approximately 500000 to caa stle the next day caa stle recorded it as paid in capital ca astle then purchased preferred shares from hunsicker not an executive of a chinese public company  and it paid her 620 per share  not 150 104 hunsicker made the same offer to sell shares from the same fictitious investor to multiple other investors  one of them purchased shares in a transaction that the company recorded as an original share issuance the proceeds from that sale were not used to repurchase shares from hunsicker or any other real selling investor  caastle used the funds for operations case 125cv05897 document 1 filed 071825 page 25 of 32 26 105 to hide that these transactions were capital raises and not true secondary sales hunsicker created and distributed false capitalization tables that omitted the new share issuances and made it appear that outstanding share levels remained flat  for example in response to a january 1 2024 request from an existing investor for the capitalization table hunsicker provided a table that undercounted the outstanding shares at the time by more than 50 million shares out of approximately 260 million  the table show ed the amount of shares that the investor expected 106 hunsicker further deceived the investor with her explanation that the changes from the last cap table are your investments retiring common shares option grants during our annual cycle and options that have exercised to common the changes hunsicker mentioned amounted to negligible sums  hunsicker omitted mention of any new share issuances from capital raising in her statement 107 caastles records show that between december 2021 and july 2023 hunsicker was the only shareholder on the sell side of a secondary transaction redeeming a total of approximately 675000 shares  for which caastle paid her 620 per share or more than 4 million 108 caastles records also show that i n the aggregate between january 2022 and december 2024 caastle raised capital through the sale of 100 million newly issued caastle shares these issuances caused caastle to exceed the number of authorized share totals in 2023 the board of directors later purportedly retroactively increased the number of authorized outstanding shares of common stock from 255 million to 350 million a 37 increase and the number of outstanding shares of preferred stock from 136100000 t o 152850000 a 12 increase case 125cv05897 document 1 filed 071825 page 26 of 32 27 iii caastles board of directors learned of hunsickers deception and the scheme ultimately unraveled 109 hunsickers scheme was ultimately uncovered by an investor who had reviewed caastles purported final fiscal year 2023 audit report in hunsickers office on october 30 2024 after noticing that the report was missing a page and appeared to contain other errors that hunsicker was unable to explain  the investor asked hunsicker for a contact at auditor 1 the audit firm whose signature was on the report 110 the investor contacted auditor 1 and was told that auditor 1 did not conduct the at issue audit and that caastle was not an active client  111 the investor told hunsicker of its call with auditor 1 and a sked for an explanation hunsickers response came days later  she acknowledged without specifying the details that there was a problem  and she gave the investor two options i do nothing and give hunsicker time to fix the issue because there was value in the company or ii redeem their shares the investor chose neither option and instead reported hunsicker to caastles board of directors 112 hunsicker resigned from caastles board of directors on december 14 2024 after admitting to her co founder and a board member that she provided false financial information to investors 113 hunsicker was allowed to remain as caastles ceo while the board conducted a further investigation but during that time restrictions were place d on her authority  she was prohibited from  among other things raising capital for caastle or communicating with investors on caastles behalf any action she took required board approval case 125cv05897 document 1 filed 071825 page 27 of 32 28 114 while the board undertook its investigation investors were not notified of hunsickers departure from the board or made aware of the concerns that an investor had raised with the board 115 between december 14 2024 and march 24 2025 hunsicker circumvented the boards restrictions and took advantage of the fact that investors remained unaware of her wrongdoing sold or purported to sell her own shares of caastle stock to existing investors in secondary transactions 116 on or about december 30 2024 hunsicker entered into an agreement with a large existing investor in which she purported to sell some or all of her personal shares the agreement was not documented in writing and hunsicker asked the investor to wire the funds to her personal bank account not caastle  between january 9 2025 and january 22 2025 the investor wired 9625000 to hunsickers personal bank account the investor was not aware that every financial statement that hunsicker had ever provided to t hem was materially false  117 a few weeks later in february 2025 hunsicker approached another investor an d offered to sell the investor 9300000 shares of her preferred and common stock at a price of 215 per share the investor was interested and as part of its due diligence asked hunsicker for a copy of the final fiscal 2023 audit report and cap table on march 11 2025 hunsicker provided the investor with the same fake fiscal 2023 audit that she had provided to investors in 2024 which led to her resignation from the board the investor noticed a number of errors and inconsistencies in the audit report and did not go through with the transaction 118 on or about march 18 2025 hunsicker provided another investor with a document that purported to be caastles income statement for the fiscal year ended september 30 2024 fiscal year 2024 which reflected revenue of more than  848 million and losses of case 125cv05897 document 1 filed 071825 page 28 of 32 29 approximately 1922 million for the fiscal year these numbers were materially false and had no basis in reality caastles internal records show fiscal 2024 revenues of approximately 113 million and losses of approximately 69 million 119 hunsicker formally resigned as caastles ceo on march 24 2025 120 on march 25 2025 the board of directors started to inform investors in a letter to investors dated march 29 2025 the board notified investors that hunsicker had stepped down as ceo and as a director and acknowledged that the companys performance to date has not matched what hunsicker claimed the letter further stated that it learned that hunsicker provided certain investors with misstated financial statements and falsified audit opinions as we ll as capitalization information that understated the number of shares outstanding the letter advised investors not to rely on any financial or capitalization information received from hunsicker in the past and it attached caastles true

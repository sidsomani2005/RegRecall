dambrosio generally did so by writing checks from herefords bank account to himself and depositing the checks into his personal bank account s 32 when herefords bank accounts lacke d sufficient cash to cover dambrosios personal expenses  dambrosio liquidate d herefords equities holdings  including by causing hereford to request redemptions from the h edge funds after the h edge funds wired hereford its redemption money dambrosio withdr ew it from herefords bank account and deposited it into his personal bank accounts  33 although herefords investors included dambrosio his wife  and his children dambrosio did not attribute his cash withdrawals from hereford to any particular investor and over time he withdrew far more cash from hereford than he and his immediate family had invested in hereford c dambrosio made misrepresentations to investors about the values of their investments in hereford 34 dambrosio falsely represent ed to the hereford investors the value of their holdings  calculating it as if he had not withdrawn their mone y from the h edge funds  35 for example in february 2010 dambrosio represented to an investor investor a that due to the alleged positive performance of hedge funds 1 and 2 in 2009 the value of her interest in hereford had increased by 218  to 1990286 as dambrosio knew or recklessly disregarded  however these nav numbers were false because they included money that dambrosio had misappropriat ed from hereford  case 125cv05884 document 1 filed 071725 page 7 of 15 8 36 in may 2016 dambrosio wrote to another investor investor b who had just made an additional contribution to her hereford capital account  i received your check in yesterdays mail and will put the funds to work i feel very good about the way its been going so far this year my research pipeline is full of good ideas i will give you the usual midyear update in a couple of months  37 contrary to his may 2016 statement to investor b dambrosio did not put investor bs  funds to work  to the contrary by may 2016 dambrosio had already withdrawn the vast majority of herefords money and no record exists of hereford making any investments with investor bs money 38 by june 2016 dambrosio had largely dissipated herefords assets hereford had approximately 150 in its bank account  approximately 43000 invested in hedge fund 3 and no other equity investments  39 after june 2016 dambrosio nonetheless continued to make false representations to investors regarding the value and performance of their investments 40 for example on august 2 2016 dambrosio sent a n investor letter to investor a regarding hereford holdings llc mid year 2016 update  which stated that the value of your interest in hereford holdings llc was 2688202 representing a 09 return for the first six months of the year that letter further stated  we had a fairly strong first quarter followed by weakness in a few positions in may and june as the market was roiled by worries over the brexit vote among other concerns currently investment sentiment is generally positive with the sp 500 index rising to all time highs in july dambrosio knew or recklessly disregarded that the nav figure that he reported to i nvestor a was false because it far exceeded the sum total of hereford s assets at the time  which amounted to less than 50000 case 125cv05884 document 1 filed 071725 page 8 of 15 9 41 after august 2016 dambrosio continued to report fraudulently overstated nav figures to hereford s investors by calculat ing them as if he had fully invested their money in hedge fund 3 in fact  dambrosio had not invested hereford funds in hedge fund 3 since 2011 and continued to request from hedge fund 3 redemptions on behalf of hereford 42 by 2023 dambrosio knew that he could not repay the amount of money that he had misappropriated from hereford but nonetheless continued to report to hereford investors navs and performance based on the false premise that he had fully invested his investors funds in the hedge funds  thus a s dambrosio knew or recklessly disregarded the navs he reported to hereford investors far exceed ed herefords actual assets 43 for example  in a july 2023 investor letter to investor a purporting to provide midyear 2023 results dambrosio falsely wrote  as of june 30 2023 the value of your interest in hereford holdings llc was 9 878208  representing a 92 increase since the end of 2022 in fact the actual value of hereford s total assets was approximately 50000 44 by december 31 2023 herefords capital account balance at hedge fund 3 was zero hereford held only 675 in its bank account  and it held no other investments 45 on january 25 2024 dambrosio report ed 2023 endofyear results to investor a stating that the value of your interest in hereford holdings llc was 8229202 representing a 90 decrease for the full year of 2023 in fact the actual value of herefords total assets was less than 1000 46 in 2023 dambrosio successfully convinced at least one investor investor c to refrain from redeeming his investment in hereford  case 125cv05884 document 1 filed 071725 page 9 of 15 10 47 in july 2023 dambrosio sent investor c a letter stating that the value of his hereford investment was 928907 as dambrosio knew or recklessly disregarded that 928907 figure was false because it far exceeded all of herefords money 48 at the same time dambrosio falsely advised investor c that hedge fund 3 would perform better in 2024 thus convinc ing investor c to refrain from redeem ing his hereford investment in 2023 49 in fact at the time he was communicating with investor c dambrosio knew or recklessly disregarded that hereford lacked the money to meet investor cs redemption request 50 in 2024 dambrosio continued to misstate to herefords investors the value of their holdings 51 for example in july 2024 dambrosio sent a mid year report to investor c  which claimed that the nav of investor cs investment had increased by 75 since year end 2023 in fact no such increase had occurred because dambrosio had depleted all of herefords money 52 in november 2024 dambrosio sent investor c a text message stating that the nav of investor cs investment was up about 25 ytd  which was likewise false 53 contrary to dambrosios false statements to investor c i n november 2024 herefords bank account held about 350 its capital account at hedge fund 3 reflected a zero balance and it held no other investments  case 125cv05884 document 1 filed 071725 page 10 of 15 11 iii dambrosios misappropriation 54 dambrosio transferred a total of approximately 55 million of hereford money to himself 55 beginning in 2011 dambrosio recorded the amounts he had withdr awn from hereford as a loan receivable updating the running tally at the end of

56 dambrosio spent the money that he withdrew from hereford in various unauthorized ways including to pay his personal expenses 57 dambrosio thus used hereford money to pay for among other things his mortgage real estate taxes food cars and travel 58 between march 2015 and december 2024 dambrosio misappropriated approximately 390000 from the hereford investors  not including those who were members

late 2024 hereford received approximately 2 million in redemption requests from various of its investors  60 hereford lacked sufficient funds to fulfill the late 2024 investor redemption requests because  by that time  dambrosio had misappropriated all hereford investor money for his personal use 61 on or about december 23 2024 dambrosio self reported his fraudulent scheme to law enforcement personnel  including the commission staff and he has since cooperated with the commission staff in its investigation of his misconduct  62 on or about december 26 2024 dambrosio informed herefords

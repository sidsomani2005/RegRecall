of clients in august 2021 gomez began soliciting prospective clients to open purported advisory accounts by having them execute investment management services agreements the advisory agreements with kg 18 the initial advisory agreements identified gomez as kgs president and cfo  and gomez signed the agreements in his purported role as kgs president and cfo  the advisor y agreements also identified kg as the investment adviser  in reality kg appears to not have been registered with any state as an llc and  upon information and belief is an assumed name used by gomez kg had no bank accounts of its own and gomez directed clients to deposit their funds into bank accounts controlled by gomez and held in his name gomez co ntrolled kg and its decision making 19 sometime in 2022 gomez phased out the kg name and purportedly began opening advisory accounts under a newly formed company named helios gomez controlled helios as its sole member similar to kg gomez requested that new clients execute advisory agreements  which identified helios as the investment adviser  the advisory agreements listed gomez as helioss president and cfo  and gomez signed the agreements on behalf of helios gomez controlle d helios and its decision making 20 gomez and helios solicited clients directly and indirectly via word of mouth from existing clients  by claiming that he was an experienced securities trader and promis ing to purchase and sell securities in separately managed client accounts that would earn double digit case 525cv00805 document 1 filed 071425 page 5 of 15 6 monthly returns he told at least one client via telephone that he wanted to help the hispanic community build generational wealth 21 defendants were each engaged in the business of advising clients as to the advisability of investing in purchasing or selling securities for compensation k g and helios offered clients three different investment management packages ranging from conservative to aggressive trading the promised returns and accompanying management fees that clients paid to kg and helios varied depending on the package with higher returns corresponding to the more aggressive package  management packages package fees aggressive day trading 350 per week weekly  monthly swing 500 per month long term growth 800 per quarter 22 the advisory agreements provided that kg and later helios would select securities to trade for each clients purported advisory account that would protect capital generate income and obtain capital growth kg and helios had broad authority under the agreements to manage and direct    on a discretionary basis each clients account and to purchase sell invest exchange convert and trade any securities and instruments and any other transaction therein for the accounts in the advisory agreements distributed throughout the relevant time period kg and helios represented to clients that kg or helios would actively trade a portfolio of select exchange traded funds and individual stocks chosen from a kg or helios newsletter however kg and helios never distributed a newsletter to their clients  b defendants falsely represented to clients that their investments were covered by insurance 23 during his solicitations  gomez promised prospective clients that their money would be safe and secure similarly in the advisory agreements defendants represented that case 525cv00805 document 1 filed 071425 page 6 of 15 7 clients purported advisory accounts were covered by insurance whether the accounts were at kg or helios according to the advisory agreements  the client accounts were insured for up to 75 of clients portfolio if the loss is categorized as a 1 catastrophic loss 2 more than 80 loss in a single business day due to market wide collapses catastrophic loss defined as 10 decline in dji spx or nasdaq market indexes in a single business day 24 gomez reiterated these false statements about insurance when talking to clients and prospective clients  in or around june 2023 one client requested proof of the purported insurance  but gomez responded that he was not legally permitted to provide such information 25 in fact defendants never created accounts for clients  nor did they secure insurance for such purported accounts when he ultimately ran out of client funds gomez told clients  including those who viewed the insurance coverage as an important part of their decision to become a client and to open an account  that helios sought a bailout loan to repay the missing funds see paragraphs 33 35 below  c gomez as kg and via helios provided false statements to clients showing substantial returns 26 per the advisory agreement s kg and helios promised to provide weekly performance statements showing each clients account performance the statements that defendants actually provided to clients were one line emails listing account balances that constantly increased case 525cv00805 document 1 filed 071425 page 7 of 15 8 27 these account statements that kg and helios sent to the clients were false kg and helios never created or funded individual client accounts they never purchased or sold securities notably the account statements failed to identify any transactions executed they just listed a fictitious value which gomez on behalf of kg and helios artificially increased which convinced clients of continued growth in their accounts  additionally these fictitious account statements persuaded certain clients to send additional funds to gomez to invest within the purported managed accounts  d defendants misappropriated client funds and used them for undisclosed purposes including making ponzi payments and paying for personal expenses 28 the advisory agreements stated that clients would deposit their funds into a kg and later a helios bank account and that the funds would then be routed to that clients personalized and managed account after signing the advisory agreement clients were typically instructed to send their money to a gomez controlled bank account  clients invested via cash and also transferred funds to defendants via checks wires bank transfers credit cards and online payment systems such as paypal and zelle client funds were commingled within these gomez controlled bank accounts 29 during the relevant time period gomez received into accounts he controlled assets from clients totaling approximately 9 million gomez used the majority of client funds to make ponzi payments to other clients  pay personal expenses pay non client third parties including for other business ventures pay employees and pay commissionsbonuses for client referrals or to make cash withdrawals 30 no client funds were transferred from the accounts gomez controlled to any trading platform contrary to the advisory agreements and gomezs promises to clients  case 525cv00805 document 1 filed 071425 page 8 of 15 9 defendants never created individual client accounts and never used

claxton have  1 not repaid any of the amounts purportedly loaned by gomez and  2 did not provide a ny services or other value in exchange for such funds  f when client funds ran out defendants tried to conceal the scheme by misleading clients regarding a n alleged bailout loan 33 on september 19 2023 gomez in his role as president of helios  sent clients a letter claiming that helios was impacted by a sudden and unrecoverable liquidation he failed to identify the reasons for the liquidation event citing a strict non disclosure agreement defendants bank records show that what gomez described as a liquidation event was simply gomez running out of money from new clients to continue his scheme 34 in his letter to clients  gomez claimed that helios had secured a guaranteed bailout loan from a lender lender to reimburse clients for any losses gomez represented that 1 the lenders commitment to the loan was steadfast 2 loan disbursements would case 525cv00805 document 1 filed 071425 page 9 of 15 10 commence immediately and 3 all clients would receive their initial capital by february 1 2024 gomez signed the letter as helioss president 35 gomezs promises about the bailout loan and repayment

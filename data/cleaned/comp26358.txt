investment scheme 36 starting in 2014 defendants be gan raising capital via loan participation agreements offere d to friends and family 37 friends and family we re later offered the opportunity to invest in promissory notes 38 in 2024 defendants expanded thei r capital raise by offering and selling promissory notes to the public via radio internet program advertisements and first libertys website 39 defendants told investors in both investment programs that the invested funds purportedly were to be used to provide bridge loans to first liberty customers who were trying to ob tain longterm loans from the sba 40 in total defendants raised at le ast 140 million from the sale of loan participation agreements and promissory notes to at least 300 investors 41 during the friends and family phase of defenda nts scheme defendants solicited invest ors to participate in specific bridge loans 42 for example frost would provide a potential investor with the total loan amount the anticipated closing date of the loan and the date upon which the loan would mature case 125cv03826mlb document 1 filed 071025 page 8 of 27 9 43 additionally frost would provide the potential investor with information about the supposed borrower th e use of the funds the existence of guarantees and the exit options for the loan 44 investor funds were pooled together to reach the total amount purportedly needed to f und a specific bridge loan 45 the terms of the publicly advertis ed note program differed from the friends and family program 46 while the publicly advertised note program offered potential investors the opportunity to provide funding for bridge loans and investor loans were pooled together investors did not participate in specific loans 47 first libertys website stated that the promissory notes allowed first liberty to provide small businesses with short term bridge loans and other commercial capital 48 as recently as may 2025 first libe rtys website stated that it had been providing commercial bridge lending since 2013 and that first liberty had funded over 100 million in bridge loans since 2013 49 both the friends and family a nd publicly advertised investments generally had a 12month term with rollove r capability and paid interest monthly 50 the friends and family agreements paid a rate of return between 14 18 with investors receiving the same inte rest rate regardless of investment size case 125cv03826mlb document 1 filed 071025 page 9 of 27 10 51 the publicly offered notes paid betw een 813 with the interest rate paid increasing based on the size of the inve stment and investment tiers starting at 25000 52 initially in the friends and family program first liberty was to be compensated from origination fee and other related fees that borrowers paid to obtain the bridge loans 53 at that time first liberty charge d 18 interest on the bridge loans and paid 18 interest on the lo an participation agreements 54 over time defendants began offeri ng loan participation agreements at 16 interest but continued charging bridge loan borrowers 18 interest on their loans 55 the loan participation agreements sp ecifically state that all the fees paid on the loan belong to first libe rty and that first liberty would be compensated by the differentia l between the per annum in terest rate paid by the borrower to first liberty and the per annum in terest rate that first liberty paid to the investors 56 some promissory notes contain a similar provision while others are silent on the issue of defendants compensation 57 frost however orally represente d to the publicly advertised note investors that he and first liberty did not take any fees out of the investor funds case 125cv03826mlb document 1 filed 071025 page 10 of 27 11 58 the difference or spread between the interest rates paid by the borrowers on the bridge loans and the inte rest rates first liberty owed investors in the friends and family  program was typically 2 59 the promissory notes issued in the publicly advertised program do not identify the spread because those notes were not tied to specific borrowers 60 largely due to the numerous defaults in the bridge loans the spread and fees collected from borrowers did not generate enough re venue to pay the interest owed to investors the ponzi scheme and misrep resentations to investors 61 frost told investors that first libe rty used 100 of the proceeds from the sales of loan participation agreements and promissory notes to fund the bridge loans 62 frost also told investors that they would be repaid from the repayment of the bridge loans and interest thereon 63 these representations were false 64 beginning no later than 2021 first liberty began operating as a ponzi scheme 65 first liberty experienced a deficit each year from 2021 thru may 30 2025 case 125cv03826mlb document 1 filed 071025 page 11 of 27 12 66 by the end of 2019 if all outsta nding loans were making interest payments the most that first liberty could generate in revenue based on the spread between the interest paid by borrowe rs on the bridge loans and the interest paid to investors was a pproximately 180000 67 in 2019 defendants incurred 1 18000 in credit card expenses leaving just 65000 to pay all other operating expenses 68 in 2020 defendants incurred 2 34000 in credit card expenses leaving just under 250000 to pa y all other operating expenses 69 by 2021 defendants payroll expense exceeded the maximum revenue that defendants coul d generate from the intere st payments on the bridge loans by almost 200000 70 in 2021 defendants also incurred 313000 in credit cared expenses which increased the de ficit to over 500000 71 and by 2022 defendants were not generating the maximum revenue from the bridge loans 72 in august 2022 a bridge loan bor rower with 62 million in loans filed bankruptcy and stopped making in terest payments on its loans 73 nevertheless in december 2022  defendants raised 65 million purportedly to make anothe r loan to this borrower case 125cv03826mlb document 1 filed 071025 page 12 of 27 13 74 defendants potential revenue each year from 2019 to present calculated using the maximum intere st generated by the bridge loans1 and deducting only payroll a nd credit card expenses2 is set forth below 75 the actual deficit for each year is substantially larger than what is reflected in the chart in paragraph 74 b ecause the bridge loans did not generate the maximum revenue 76 instead most of the bridge loan s defaulted and ceased making interest payments 77 as of 2021 approximately 80 of in terest and principal payments to investors were sourced from new investor funds and not from bridge loan interest payments or principal repayments 1 the analysis does not include any inte rest payments from the bridge loan borrower who filed ba nkruptcy in august 2022 but does include the interest payments owed to invest ors for the bridge loans made to that borrower 2 first liberty incurred other expenses th at are not included in this calculation case 125cv03826mlb document 1 filed 071025 page 13 of 27 14 78 by at least 2021 frost knew that ma ny bridge loans were in default and that many borrowers were not paying the interest due on their bridge loans 79 nevertheless first liberty continue d to make interest payments to investors 80 when soliciting new investors frost misrepresented the default rate of the bridge loans to investors 81 specifically in connection with selling both the friends and family investments and the publicly advertised not es frost told some investors including one as recently as may 2025 that first li berty had only ever had one bridge loan default 82 as recently as may 2025 when selli ng an investment frost told an investor that when the one bridge loan de faulted first liberty paid investors back with its own funds 83 when selling to other investors frost represented that only a few bridge loans had defaulted 84 in reality the default rates were significantly higher indeed potentially 90 of the bridge lo ans are currently in default 85 frosts representations regarding th e success of first libertys bridge loan program were material to investor s when deciding to invest with first liberty case 125cv03826mlb document 1 filed 071025 page 14 of 27 15 86 frost also misled investors about th e security of th e bridge loans 87 when selling investments frost told investors that the borrowers to whom first liberty made bridge loan s had already received approval for sba loans and that the bridge loan was only needed to provide funds while the sba loan process was completed 88 in fact few if any bridge loan borrowers had received preapproval for an sba loan at the time the bridge lo an was funded and frost knew that few bridge loans were ever converted to sba loans 89 frost also misled investors about the security of their existing investments to obtain additional i nvestments from those investors 90 for example in 2019 an individua l invested 500000 in connection with a 34 million bridge loan to the br idge loan borrower who filed bankruptcy in august 2022 91 the 34 million bridge loan clos ed in october 2019 and was to mature in may 2021 first loan 92 subsequently first liberty made a second bridge loan to the same borrower in november 2019 for 900000 th at was to mature in june 2021 second loan case 125cv03826mlb document 1 filed 071025 page 15 of 27 16 93 in may 2021 after the first loan matured but the investor was not repaid first liberty made a third loan to the same borrower for 15 million third loan 94 in september 2021 first liberty ma de a fourth loan to the same borrower for 400000 fourth loan 95 in august 2022 the borrower filed for bankruptcy and ceased making interest payments on the bridge loans issued by first liberty 96 in december 2022 after the ba nkruptcy filing first liberty purportedly made a fifth loan to the same borrower for 65 million 97 in may 2024 frost solicited the investor in the first loan for a new investment 98 frost offered the investor the opport unity to participate with other investors in a loan that would be used to help fund a company that was developing a healthcare app 99 in response the investor inquired a bout the status of repayment of his 500000 investment in the first loan 100 frost told the investor that the firs t loan was scheduled to pay off in june and that he was very confident that it will case 125cv03826mlb document 1 filed 071025 page 16 of 27 17 101 frost also told the investor that the borrower was up 20 yoy year over year in noi net operating income  and our lending partner who is refinancing this for us is very eager to get it done 102 relying on frosts representations about the status of his 500000 investment the investor made an investment of 200000 in a loan to first liberty 103 frost knew his statements to the i nvestor about the first loan were false when he made them 104 frost knew by october 2022 that th e bridge loan borrower was in bankruptcy 105 on october 28 2022 first liberty filed a claim against the borrower in bankruptcy 106 the bankruptcy claim filed by first liberty identified only the second and third loan 107 first liberty did not make a claim for the 34 million first loan 108 the bankruptcy court ultimately approved an unsecured claim for first liberty of 375000 no payment has been made on first libertys claim 109 until first liberty shuttered opera tions in june 2025 the investor received monthly interest payments on his 500000 investment in the first loan case 125cv03826mlb document 1 filed 071025 page 17 of 27 18 defendants fail to disclose the significant default rates 110 each loan participation agreement contained a provision stating that first liberty would provide notice to the i nvestor if first liberty obtained actual notice or knowledge or any loss of property or change in financial condition or any obligor under the loan which will ha ve a material adverse effect upon continuation of payments under the lo an or its repayment on default 111 defendants failed to provide invest ors with notice of changes in borrowers financial conditio ns despite knowing that ma ny bridge loan borrowers had defaulted and that the default would have a material adverse effect on the continuation of interest payments and the repayment of the principal amount 112 by at least 2021 defendants issued loan participation agreements containing this notice provision knowing that they did not intend to comply with it 113 the loan participation agreements also contained a provision requiring the investors consent before first libe rty could make additional loans to the borrower 114 defendant failed to seek investor consent before making additional loans to existing bridge loan borrowers case 125cv03826mlb document 1 filed 071025 page 18 of 27 19 115 by at least 2021 defendants issued loan participation agreements containing the consent provision knowing th at they did not intend to comply with it 116 as recently as june 2025 frost was soliciting investments in a 35 million loan and telling investors that firs t libertys
